Curious, anyone in need of a competent, innovative and trustworthy Rust developer who has previous bioinformatics experience?  I have loads of experience within the software industry as a whole, and resume can be found at:

[https://apexpl.io/Resume\_Matt\_Dizak.pdf](https://apexpl.io/Resume_Matt_Dizak.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

I previously worked as the personal developer to a biologist out of Otawwa, so although by no means am I a biologist, I am at least somewhat acquainted with the space.  Know how to read and write fasta files, understand various programs including buy not limited to exonnerate, blasp, hmmsearc, et al, coordinates (ali, env, hmm), best reciprocal hits, scoring, overlaps, codon tables, and so on

&amp;#x200B;

Did things such as translated majority of Orthograph ([https://github.com/mptrsen/Orthograph](https://github.com/mptrsen/Orthograph)) into Rust, providing a \~1800% speed increase.  Plus things such as, SQLite was being used with one database per-species, and was able to drop the hard disk usage by \~70% by flipping everything over to RocksDB, and things of that nature.  I unfortunately can't release any of that code, as although not under contract, am a man of my word and promised the biologist I wouldn't until after his final conference in July 2023 once his work is submitted for peer review.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a solid Rust developer, easy to get along with, available 16 hours/day, and can learn whatever is necessary.  If you have any development you need done, whether it's a new pipeline, streamlining an existing pipeline, making things more efficient, or what have you, please feel free to reach out.

bioinformatics,"I want to quickly check whether a particular gene sequences okay on Illumina machines by having a look at some example WGS data in IGV.

I want to see for myself if the region looks any better with Illumina reads but I've not been able to identify any public pre-mapped reads.

I know I can look some up in ENA, download them, map them, and then check that way. But I wanted to ask this question nonetheless because it would be useful to know for future reference, it would be quicker this way, and frankly it would suprise me if no such resource existed.

bioinformatics,"The input dataset I think should be the methylation data, all the values ranging from 0-1 and including NA values. For these NA values, my boss wants to avoid any imputation method, but it's a large portion of the data and quite a few entries in the methylation table is NA.

I've been thinking about how to approach it. Just select the CpG where every sample has high quality coverage of the site? That is the approach taken by this paper: [https://bio-protocol.org/exchange/minidetail?type=30&amp;id=9005133](https://bio-protocol.org/exchange/minidetail?type=30&amp;id=9005133). It works momentarily. I remove the samples that are far away from the center of the PCA plot and I get a much larger number of CpG included, but the matrix becomes non-positive definite and non-solvable. The next obvious step is to just use the differentially methylated loci, but that data is limited. The comparison tests are saying that few CpG appear different between conditions. 

I also wonder it it might be more informative to give PCA my methylated and unmethylated counts as complex numbers where methylated are the real and unmethylated are the imaginary parts. Since it will be normalized before PCA, I'm not sure it it'll actually have much of a difference, though.

The data is also really large -- 4 million CpG x 100 samples. Any tips to deal with it are helpful, btw. The ending PCA matrix is only 100x100, but still.

I'm working on a moth and often have SNP variants that are adjacent to each other. I am looking to annotate these variants to get a sense of what they do. I've been mostly using SnpEff but am having a problem with adjacent SNPs which get called independently, rather than as one combined variant, often leading to incorrect predictions like stop codons in the middle of proteins (when it's actually a mis-sense mutant when read together, as in the case below). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jtc1bpf9fwaa1.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54761221ee6bd4c320e3a32608571ad520c0eab5

I believe these types of variants should be called as MNPs but I can't seem to get this working consistently across samples ([see BCFTools issue](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/issues/1843))?  


I've tried:

* BCFTools but this doesn't seem to be calling them as MNPs (issue raised)
* GATK process (haplotype caller -&gt; genotype gVCFs) but the default mode doesn't output MNP calls, it outputs single variants which are then phased in the genotype field for each sample (which means that SnpEff still sees them as seperate calls)
* GATK with MNP mode works for individual samples but I am not able to combine multiple samples using combineGVCF (this is not supported by GatK)
* Freebayes does this but ends up outputting very long haplotype calls  which I struggle to combine between samples ( see example 2 in this issue ([https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff/issues/305](https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff/issues/305) for freebayes output)
* BCFTools csq for annotation aware of phasing (for GatK output) but the annotation format is a very specific gff3 type and I've tried converting my organism's gff3 without success.  


Any thoughts? I've attached the .bam and truncated reference for the above screenshot in the GitHub issue for BCFtools if anyone would like to have a go!  


I just feel like I'm missing something obvious when I'm struggling to get consistent types of calling across my samples! And I feel like the adjacent SNP problem can't just be limited to my organism? How do others deal with this?

&amp;#x200B;

When I used BLASTX it seemed to corroborate the annotated sequences for these proteins, to the degree that BLAST hits align along the annotated region and not the snapgene-predicted CDS regions that aren't part of the annotated CDS.  However, I'm not sure how convincing this is - it says the annotated region is most similar to other BLAST database entries, but presumably the query could simply be a novel version of a database protein.  

In other cases (where the protein was in a BGC and could be compared to homologs in homologous BGCs with the same synteny) it looks like the annotation is wrong and one protein has been broken into several bits.  For example, SD37\_RS42595 looks like it should be part of a bigger protein (orange arrow), and when I blast that I get the protein I would expect (a PKS) with complete query coverage.:

Can anyone answer (i) why CDS without start and stop codons are being annotated and (ii) how far they would trust the annotations?  How would you normally deal with this - would you take the annotated sequence as the true protein, or extend/truncate the annotated protein either end until it matches the snapgene CDS for the annotated protein?

bioinformatics,"While long ago I hailed from the realm of biochemistry, I'm sitting more on the data side these days and can't help but be nostalgic for the possible use of generative neural nets on the bio side. Having a little curiosity, I found that this work has already began somewhat.

For instance, this group managed to get a reasonable design schema by incorporating Attention into their GANs:  [https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00310-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00310-5)

To me then, if we can develop ""reasonable"" (i.e. soluble among other properties) protein sequences using GANs, a natural extension would be to train them for selective binding. For instance, imagine adding the loss from pre-trained Discriminator that predicts binding a certain target into the above.

On one hand, that seems like a tall order, but given some of the research I've thumbed through, I believe such a discriminator is already shown as tenable. Here's a few papers:

* [A meta review of the topic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037022004044)
* [An implementation using Attention](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222014419)
* [Another implementation](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i802/5093239)

Being able to serve up amino acid sequences with selective binding properties seems really attractive and a natural ""next step"" for GAN research here. The closest I have seem though is [this work](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.27.478054v1.abstract) which is more of the flavor of redesigning a sequence rather than a de novo approach.

In short, I reconstructed the MAGs after binning the contigs in my assembly with various binning tools. Then, I aligned the cleaned raw reads from my samples with the contigs belonging to the different MAGs, which allows me to know the number of reads belonging to the different genomes in my dataset. 
After that, I normalize the number of reads by the length of the contigs, to get the average coverage per MAG between my samples.

I thus finally have a MAGs-coverage matrix with the samples in column and the MAGs in raw. So the structure is the same as an OTU abundance matrix derived from metabarcoding data, and I want to compare my different samples to potentially show patterns between my biological conditions.

bioinformatics,"Hello, I ran into an issue processing bulk RNA-seq data from a [study](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30489-X) using my own workflow. Briefly, DESeq2 shows gene expression changes opposite of what the study reports. I suspect some issue in my workflow where the control v non-control data was flipped, but I'm having trouble finding where the error is after some preliminary troubleshooting. However, I suspect the issue might be related to how I'm running DESeq2.

**Context**

I recently processed raw bulk RNA-seq data from [GEO-deposited study data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147507), specifically two biopsied lungs of patients who succumbed to COVID-19 and two biopsied lungs of healthy patients. Each of the four biopsies had four technical replicates. The sequencing depths of the healthy patient biopsies were significantly greater than that of the COVID-19 patient biopsies.

**Data Processing**

I used sratoolkit to download the sra files and dump the fastq files on my drive. I concatenated them, trimmed them with trim-galore and aligned them using hisat2. Subsequently, I did the usual conversion to bam, ran samtools fixmate and sorted them before removing duplicates with samtools markdup. Finally, I ran featureCounts on them before collating them into a four-columned dataframe and running them on DESeq2.

To illustrate my confusion, I show the un-normalized counts of two genes of the four-columned dataframe:

geneid	treatment1	treatment2	control1	control2

ENSG00000108691.10	154	412	1288	695

ENSG00000108700.5	59	182	297	97

ENSG00000116016.14	9	51	3001	2729

treatment1 and treatment2 are the counts of COVID-19 patient lungs while control1 and control2 are the counts of healthy patient lungs. ENSG00000108691.10 (CCL2) was greatly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 patients and ENSG00000108700.5 (CCL8) had an even more positive log2foldchange as compared with CCL2 according to the study. ENSG00000116016.14 is a random gene I picked (EPAS1). If I take the countData, averaged out the counts of treatment v control for CCL2, CCL8 and EPAS1 (just for the sake of example) before getting the ratio, it turns out the ratio of treatment:control is highest for CCL8 (0.59:1), followed by CCL2 (0.28:1) and finally EPAS1 (0.01:1).

Based on these and the lower sequencing depth of treatment1 and treatment2, I was expecting DESeq2 to show CCL8 (ENSG00000108700.5) as most upregulated, followed by CCL2 (ENSG00000108691.10), and finally EPAS1 as downregulated or least upregulated. What I got after DESeq2 processing instead was CCL2's log2foldchange = -4.4, CCL8's log2foldchange = -5.6 and EPAS1's log2foldchange = 0.82. Below is the code I ran in R:

    dds &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=bigTable, colData=metaData, design=~+dex, tidy = TRUE)
    dds$dex &lt;- relevel(dds$dex, ref = ""control"")
    dds &lt;- DESeq(dds)
    res &lt;- results(dds)

The metadata.csv file I used was:

    id,dex,celltype
    treatment1,treatment,lung
    treatment2,treatment,lung
    control1,control,lung
    control2,control,lung

Based on the DESeq2 results, it seems I somehow flipped the control and treatment datasets during the DESeq2 processing. Based on [this](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#note-on-factor-levels) vignette, it seems I correctly assigned control as the [reference level](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/329027_593046fb6d7a427da6b2c538caf601e1.html).

bioinformatics,"I'll preface this question the same way I did my last question in this sub: I'm really sorry that I don't know the vocabulary. I'm a first-year CS PhD student with no previous exposure to bioinformatics, so I apologize if these are painfully basic questions.

First question, what is this annotation for ""typing"" the structure of a molecule called? It's parentheses and dots and maybe sometimes brackets? As an example, go to Frabase: [http://rnafrabase.cs.put.poznan.pl/index.php?act=create\_query](http://rnafrabase.cs.put.poznan.pl/index.php?act=create_query) and just click ""Search"". The annotation can be found in the ""Secondary Structure"" column of the resulting page.

Second question, how does one deduce that annotation? For example, I know from Frabase that the dot annotation for 1EHZ should be something like  `(((((((..((((.....[..)))).((((.........)))).....(((((..]....))))))))))))....` . Is there a way I can deduce that string from the JSON returned from the assembly endpoint in the PDB Data API here:  [https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/assembly/1EHZ/1](https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/assembly/1EHZ/1) or any other endpoint from the PDB Data API?

Basically, my goal is to take the PDB ID `1EHZ`, send it to the protein databank data API, and print out the dot annotation from the JSON returned by the API. I assume there's some algorithm that can take the assembly information and return that dot annotation, or maybe even another service that does the same.

bioinformatics,"So, I did look at the FAQ and couldn't quite find an answer to this.   


Background:

I got my BA in biology back in 2019 and just graduated with my Master's in bio this past May (2022). I originally had the idea to teach in the community college setting and was working as a lab manager at a local community college until a year ago when I realized teaching was NOT for me.   
Now I work as a Customer Support at a small education simulation company. 

I realized this past year how much I enjoy working in data analytics, and bioinformatics or computational biology seem like a good use of my formal education as well as what I actually like to do.

Question:

What do I do to be a marketable candidate for data analytics or bioinformatics type roles? 

Since I have both a BA and MS in bio, I feel like I have the educational background in the biology side of this, but I have no formal education in any sort of coding languages except a little bit in R during my undergrad. 

My search has taken me to places like Coursera where I see a lot of certificates that I could potentially work on to show a more formal education in the informatics side of this career. 

If you saw my resume with the BA and MS in just biology and only a a coursera certificate or two, would I really be marketable? 

I want to make sure I'm pursuing a course of action that is most efficient (i.e. if the ""IBM Data Science Professional Certificate"" on coursera doesn't do squat to help me find a job in the field, I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere).

My labmates/PI do not usually conduct much work of this kind either, so I’m on my own for this current project. It may seem like a very simple task but I’m kind of overwhelmed by all the information online and was hoping I could just get pointed in the right direction… 

The task: I have received paired genome sequences for a couple of bacterial clinical isolates (fastq format). I believe I need to align these sequences to a reference genome to generate a list of indels/SNPs and get an overall sense of which mutations are present in the isolates, which I don’t really know how to do. I’m afraid there might be larger islands missing/present in the clinical isolate genomes which may affect this analysis (?). Though I’d like to compare to our lab reference genome, is it possible that I’d have to align these sequences to a more closely related reference? 

More context: I have successfully analyzed RNA seq reads using KBase in the past and would like to stick with this program if at ALL possible because it feels pretty user friendly for a n00b like me. I just followed a collaborator’s workflow but didn’t have the strongest grasp of all the apps and don’t think I could confidently alter this to work for a new project.

1) AMD threadripper pro 5955wx (16 core, 32 thread, 4-4.5ghz, huge cache, basically beastly stats)
2) Intel xeon W-2275 (14 core, 28 thread,  3.3-4.6ghz, ok cache). 

It seems like a bit of a no-brainer here. Buying custom pre built from Dell. Reached out to the dell rep to see if the newer generation xeon (I think 3335?) is available on a precision workstation but even then AMD seems to blow it out of the water. My understanding is that AMD has been ahead of Intel in the computer space for a couple years now, but I have no idea as far as workstations/servers go. Is there any reason to choose the Intel over the AMD here?

Use case is primarily multi-omics analysis at both single cell and bulk levels.

The ones that are labeled (i.e., the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset - for classification, the BraTS dataset - for image segmentation, the Kaggle datasets for skin cancer) are the ones most commonly seen being used in FL.

⭐ 3. The largest majority of papers we found use cancer datasets for benchmarking purposes: very few federated learning works solve an actual clinically relevant question. Many of the papers we reviewed propose new software frameworks, and virtually none follow-up with a clinical trial. This leaves FL absent from the field of clinical oncology, based on our literature review.

⭐ 4. The compliance and security aspect of healthcare still poses the largest hurdle. Commercial entities such as EHR vendors (e.g., Epic Systems, Cerner, Meditech, Allscripts, etc.), PACS vendors (e.g., GE, Philips, Hitachi, Siemens, Canon, etc.), and other hardware manufacturers (e.g., Nvidia, Intel, etc.) seem to be the best positioned to start pulling together resources, data, and models that use FL to improve patient outcomes.

bioinformatics,"Hello,

I am trying to reproduce the RNA-seq results of [a paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27807035/). I am following their workflow, as outlined in the supplemental materials:

""mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)

Reads obtained from the sequencing were aligned to the human genome (hg19, NCBI37) using STAR (version 2.2.0.c, default parameters) (Dobin et al. 2013). Only reads that aligned uniquely to a single genomic location were used for downstream analysis (MAPQ &gt; 10). Gene expression values were calculated for annotated RefSeq genes using HOMER by counting reads found overlapping exons (Heinz et al. 2010). Differentially expressed genes were found from two replicates per condition using EdgeR (Robinson et al. 2010). Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID (Dennis et al. 2003).""

\[X\] use STAR to align raw reads to hg19 

\[  \] use HOMER to count reads on overlapping exons &lt;- Stuck, oh so stuck.

bioinformatics,"As the title suggests, I am struggling to get Geneious to function on my Macbook Pro after updating it to Monterey version 12.6 in order to solve a previous computer functionality problem. 

Before the update, I used Geneious Version 8.1.9 (on Mac OS Big Sur) and it worked perfectly. Because of the nature of my lab's Geneious license, I cannot use a newer version of Geneious than 8.1.9. 

I have attempted to remove and reinstall the program (I also trashed the installers; however, I did not trash my previous .geneious files, or my Geneious/Geneious Prime backups). For the sake of testing, I also attempted to reinstall the newest version of Geneious, R11.1 (even though it won't work with my lab's license). Both versions successfully installed in my Applications folder, but returned malware warnings upon first opening (see screenshot below).

[Malware warning popup box](https://preview.redd.it/pbcfjhg72z5a1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ec3ec9a2f4b94ee48a738745c95ebe3791516046)

I evaded the malware warning through Get Info &gt; Override Malware Protection. Subsequent attempts to open simply crashed immediately with a popup box saying that Geneious ""quit unexpectedly"" (see screenshots below). Again - this happened with *both* Geneious version 8.1.9 and 11.1.

The crash.log file in my Geneious 8.1 Data folder dates from 3 months ago instead of from today when the problem arose. (The JavaAppLauncher crash reports date from today, but I can't make heads or tails of them.)

[Crash warning popup box for 8.1.9](https://preview.redd.it/gzawm35m2z5a1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=004e8f7aa3a94c5bb7e4bca2c07fb27e937eae59)

Interestingly, I was able to install and use Geneious Prime 2023 without issue from the [same website](https://www.geneious.com/download/previous-versions/). This did *not* crash, nor did it generate any malware warnings like its full-version cousin, and I don't know why the difference there.

The only solution I can find online is to revert my laptop back to its previous OS via completely wiping the hard drive, which would (as I understand it) require me to, before the wipe, manually isolate and save on a *different* external hard drive every file I need to preserve. I do not find this an efficient solution, I can't be sure it would work, and I do not want the problem I originally updated to Monterey to solve to return. I also don't want to have to purchase a second laptop solely to run an old OS and Geneious on.

I have submitted a support request to [Geneious](https://help.geneious.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) already and am waiting to hear back from them.

Has anyone else encountered this problem with Geneious before and/or could potentially assist me with, or direct me to other avenues for, troubleshooting this issue?

bioinformatics,"So I was given a sample sequenced through Pacbio’s new Mas-iso seq platform. PacBio has returned the result and I needed the files necessary for a Seurat compatible input ( so the matrix, barcodes, and features). I also needed the bam file to visualize the bam file in IGV. Both were present in the final output but I’m noticing a strange result that I can’t explain.   
Essentially, IGV is displaying reads and their corresponding UMI that are not present in the Seurat object, even though the cell barcodes are present in both. And I'm not sure why.   


[Screenshot of IGV visualization and information on a random read aligned to CALR. I have highlighted the Cell Barcode ](https://preview.redd.it/xxb4ud6sby5a1.png?width=2772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a92b3d7a88ef37acd05d20c62eca5c921b99d1a6)

So the screenshot shows many reads aligning to CALR and with good coverage. But when I check the seurat object, there is only one cell that detects 1 UMI.   
I generated plots from a downstream analysis of the Seurat object that shows the same discrepancy but here I will show the raw dataset to simplify it and show that filtering is not occurring.   


    #Loading in seurat compatible files in genes_seurat folder (matrix, genes, barcodes) 
    
    
    pb_dataset &lt;-  Read10X(""path/to/genes_seurat"", gene.column = 2, cell.column = 1, unique.features = TRUE, strip.suffix = FALSE)
    
    #Indexing the count matrix based off gene name to get a list of cells and their UMI counts associated with CALR
    
    
    calr_umi_counts_pb &lt;- as.data.frame(pb_dataset['CALR',])
    calr_umi_counts_pb &lt;- cbind(calr_umi_counts_pb, rownames(calr_umi_counts_pb))
    

This code outputs a dataframe of UMI counts across Cell barcodes for one gene. I've added another column based off the rownames to be able to search for barcodes.   


[Resulting table based on descending order of UMI counts. ](https://preview.redd.it/0xza0zj2dy5a1.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b5c0e7c0bdb62bc29cac4652ff5503d6271793c4)

This shows only one cell detects one UMI for CALR which is very different than what IGV is showing. And this dataset was generated just by loading in the files necessary to create a Seurat object. So no downstream filtering has occurred.  
Next I looked to see if maybe the cells being visualized in IGV weren’t in the Seurat Object so I randomly selected one read which is why I highlighted the cell barcode in my first screenshot which was CATTCTATGCCTACGG. 

The same sample had been sequenced through 10x because the original question was an interest in comparing transcript coverage. So they share the same cell barcodes but the PB data has to have its barcodes reverse complemented (I believe because of how it's being sequenced in the ZMW but I could be wrong). So reverse transcribing the Cell Barcode I highlighted, you get CCGTAGGCATAGAATG. 

When I search the PB datagrame for that cell barcode, it is present but no UMIs are detected. Even though that same cell had displayed a read in IGV. 

[Looking at a specific cell barcode with 0 UMI count even though the IGV displayed a read ](https://preview.redd.it/ser52rvmdy5a1.png?width=2222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5743fcc6d085088c5b02671e55a74b9f413990e3)

Is there something about IGV I am grossly misunderstanding? I don't think there is anything wrong with my R script but maybe thats also an issue? I recreated the bam file following PacBio’s pipeline and got the same bam file as their platform has given so I’m very lost here. I would appreciate any strategy or direction

I am currently doing a project where I am given a gene (POLD1) and theoretical mutations at certain points in the coding sequence. One of the changes causes a frameshift and therefore all the codons/proteins after this shift are altered.

bioinformatics,"I'm a first-year PhD student, with a B.S. in microbiology. I have intermediate level experience with java/javascript/python but only for personal projects; I don't have any formal training in computer science. I'm finishing up my second of two rotations and I need to pick a lab soon; both of my rotation advisors have told me they would take me if I wanted to join their lab. But I'm having trouble choosing, and I think a lot of it comes down to not fully understanding the state of the field and what type of skills would be more/less useful to pick up during my PhD. 

Both labs are fairly similar on their face; they both develop tools for analyzing microbial DNA sequences. Both are 100% dry lab. I get along extremely well with both of the advisors and I enjoyed both of my rotations immensely. I'll term them lab A and lab B.

Lab A develops tools for transposon analysis. It's the new/hip/modern ""where the field is going"" lab, as the advisors of both lab A and lab B have told me. It's ""pipeline-oriented"", makes use of environment management tools like conda, and its publications focus on both the tools themselves and the actual conclusions that can be drawn from them, so they publish in both bioinformatics and genetics journals. Although the lab itself is a 100% dry lab, they do have collaborations and co-publications with wet labs. I would be working primarily on data analysis using an existing program the lab has developed; the PI wants to bring on another student to keep developing it, but has essentially said that he wants someone with a computer science background, so it wouldn't be me.

Lab B is the lab of a very senior professor, who isn't taking on students anymore but has agreed to make an exception for me (he taught one of my intro classes and we've talked a lot outside of class as I'm a trans dude and he has a trans son that's my age). In this lab, I would have my own project, started from scratch, writing a program to process some kind of DNA data and get some kind of output (either my rotation project, or if that doesn't go anywhere, a new project we would come up with). The PI is very oriented toward low-level programming languages and algorithm development, which I don't have much past experience with but I think would be very interesting. He's intonated that this part of the field is more competitive, though.

Importantly, Lab B doesn't have any funding. However, he's arranged for the department to fund me for spring (the department has a lot more money than students interested in the program, as admission is through a general-biology admission program, and some years, like this one, only a couple students join the binf department). After that I would be TAing the graduate-level BINF classes I've taken for the remainder of my PhD (my school doesn't have an undergraduate BINF program). Lab A doesn't have guaranteed funding, so I may or may not have to TA, but the PI is still actively applying for grants, so it's likely that I wouldn't have to TA every semester and may not have to TA at all.

I could see myself enjoying both labs for sure, and I'm not sure which one would be better to join. My partner works in computer science and has suggested that ""efficient programming"" --ie the algorithm development/low level efficient stuff -- may not actually be very important in career prospects (""if your program takes more storage space than it needs to, the company will just buy more hard drives""), but that it's a harder skill to pick up so if I want to learn it, doing it now is a good idea. I am quite interested in it but I'm concerned that competitiveness/oversaturation in that field may be an obstacle both to publication and to eventually getting a job in that area. I guess my questions are:

1) Is one group of skills more useful than another or more important to get ""early on"" in my career?

2) How are the prospects in each sub-field? Is algorithm development too saturated?

3) If I'm not sure which area I will end up in long term, would training in one area now give me more or less narrow future options?

My highest priorities at present are using a de novo, RNA-seq specific (splice-aware) assembler. I will need to parse the assembly using alignment methods to identify reads of interest.

Per the paper linked below, I have found 3 possibilities - SqueezeMeta, MOSCA, and IMP (I'm not interested in using HUMAnN for several reasons).

[**https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00904/full**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00904/full)

SqueezeMeta and MOSCA both use metagenomic de novo assemblers, which is my main reservation in attempting to use them. Using metagenomic assemblers for RNA-seq data is not a validated approach, to my knowledge. IMP requires a corresponding metagenome, which I do not have for these samples.

The paper also demonstrates that Trinity has been shown to be at least somewhat effective for de novo metatranscriptome assembly, despite being designed for single-organism assembly. Several Biostars posts also suggest that Trinity is a good option for this.

So, here's what I'm thinking I'll try.

1. Filter human reads using STAR
2. Trim and assemble the remaining reads using Trinity
3. Use the assembly to generate a gff and amino acid fasta using Prodigal
4. Use other tools to identify reads of interest using the protein fasta (BLAST, etc)
5. Align reads using the gff and STAR (or maybe hisat2)

bioinformatics,"Hi all,

  I checked the FAQs for my situation but most of the pinned threads were pre-pandemic and thus pre remote-work boom. I am currently pursuing an MS in bioinfo. Having finished what I believe will be the toughest course for me, I'm trying to think about my future. Before, the nature of my work meant I had to live in Boston / SF / San Diego to get a good job, or at least, to have a proper amount of companies such that I could job hop every two years and work my way up to scientist, or some ultimate position where I was still in the laboratory. Now is seems that the nature of my new work, this will not be the case. So I'd like to hear from the community on the following questions or points of discussion:

1. What percentage of computational biologist / bioinformatics scientist positions do you believe are remote? Is it industry standard expectation to want the bioinformatician to move to the same city as their employer?
2. If indeed my position will be remote, as I am hoping it will be, do you think I would be limiting my career by moving to a non-hub? (US). Like a city which has decent size but definitely not a lot of biotech or pharma companies? (This is most or at least many major US cities). 
3. Do you think I'd be in a better position by moving to Boston / SF / San Diego (really really really hoping to not have to do this). I love SD but its like 3k miles away from my family.",Remote work and Bioinformatics,1670877385

I often use the `GSEA` function of the `clusterProfiler` package downstream of my differential gene expression analysis. If I understand it correctly, `clusterProfiler::GSEA` uses `fgsea` under the hood to estimate significance levels and for that, it permutates the **gene labels**. 

However, if I remember correctly, the ""original"" GSEA implementation (i.e. the one from [Subramanian et al.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0506580102)), actually permutates the class labels to preserve gene-gene correlations.

So I was wondering, if there actually is an implementation of the ""original"" GSEA algorithm that can be called from R. I think the python package `gseapy` can do it for example.

bioinformatics,"The key idea is to take advantage of the stochastic nature of diffusion to generate a probability distribution that is used to determine the location of the mutation. In particular, the model is designed to have a very high probability of occurring in a region of interest (ROI), but a low probability of occuring in other regions that are not of interest. This is in contrast to the more commonly used Monte Carlo method, which attempts to assign a probability to every point in the model space.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a number of issues to be dealt with when trying to implement this in software. First, one has to be careful not to overfit the model to the data. This can be done by using a Bayesian estimator of the likelihood of the model, as is done in the paper cited above. Another issue is that, as mentioned above, the model has to be able to deal with non-Gaussian distributions. A solution to this is to use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the generation of the distribution. This is an iterative algorithm that allows one to iteratively improve the model as one goes through the process of mutation and diffusion. However, it is computationally expensive, and requires a lot of memory to store the state of the model at each iteration.

&amp;#x200B;

In my work, I’ve been looking at ways to speed up the MCMC algorithm. One of the things that I’ve come up with is to use a technique known as backpropagation. This is a well-studied technique for learning to solve problems that are hard to solve by hand. For example, it is used in machine learning to find patterns in data that are hidden from the user. The idea is that the data is divided into blocks, and each block is trained on a subset of the data. After training, the blocks are recombined to form a model that generalizes to the rest of the data. This technique is very powerful, and can be used to train models that are much more complex than those that can be trained by hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Backpropagation works by applying a gradient descent algorithm to the model. Gradient descent is a fairly simple algorithm, but one that is difficult to get right. It is easy to fall into what is known as the Levenshtein-Fokker-Planck (LFP) trap, where the gradient descends too quickly, and ends up converging to a value that is too close to the value that you want to converge to. To avoid this, one has to make sure that the gradient is slow enough to give time for the algorithm to converge to the right value. This is a problem that has been tackled by a number of researchers, most notably John Resig \[4\]. He has found a way to do this by adding a delay to the gradient descent algorithm. This delay is based on the length of the block of data that is being trained. If the block is small, there is little need for a delay, and the algorithm can be run quickly. On the other hand, if the block is large, it is better to wait a little longer before running the algorithm, so that the algorithm has more time to converge to the right value.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that this might be a good idea for a model that is going to be used to solve problems that are hard to solve by hand. So I wrote a program that implements the algorithm, and tested it on a number of problems. Here are the results:

&amp;#x200B;

The performance is good, and I was able to get it to converge to the right value in less than 10,000 iterations. This is a lot faster than the time it would take to run the algorithm by hand, and it is comparable to the performance of the LFP algorithm that Resig used in his paper.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the problems that I ran into was that the algorithm didn’t seem to work very well on images that had noise in them. This is because the noise is spread across the image, and it is difficult to tell where the noise is coming from. I ended up having to do some work to make things work, but it was worth it to get the algorithm to work as well as it did.",Thoughts on using Diffusors For Bio?,1670469219
bioinformatics,"I'm about 16 months into my postdoc, and am coming to the swift and startling realization that the tenure track is not for me. The thought of scraping by on mid five-figure salaries for the next 3-5 (or more) years with minimal benefits and poor work/life balance only to \*maybe\* get a PI position that would bring with it the additional stress of securing grants just to get by makes me want to vomit. Plus, I am becoming increasingly more angry at being a cog in the academic machine that values postdocs not as doctorate-level thinkers but as a nearly free source of undervalued labor.

So now I'm looking around at my 55k/year postdoc salary while still feeling like I'm being treated much like a grad student and wondering what I am still doing here.

I have a strong wet-lab background, but am truly  passionate about computational science. I am in no means a computer programer, but I have a very solid understanding of molecular biology, which gives me a leg-up when it comes to data analysis and understanding experimental methods/design. I have experience with Python, R, and Linux shell scripting, and have done a tone of transcriptomics analysis and 16S amplicon community analysis for microbiome projects. I don't have any ML experience, but that's something I'd be very excited about getting into.

Since I am straying away from the PI track and my current lab isn't providing me much advanced training/mentorship, I've gotten in the rut of feeling like I'm just an underpaid lab tech, which is NOT why I got my PhD. I shouldn't feel this way....I don't work much more than 40 hours a week and am decently productive publication wise, but I just feel so blah going into work every day. It would be so nice to be excited about my role again and feel valued for my skills and contributions (both monetarily and within the lab!). 

The must-haves on my future job list are: 

* Remote/hybrid work (I do not want to relocate but would travel every other month or so for meetings and such)
* Make a decent amount of money for my education level (100k+ would be ideal)
* Have a trusting supervisor who values my work and trusts me to get it done on my own schedule (obviously would be available during certain times for meetings and such)
* Decent vacation/benefits and generally good work/life balance (right now I get 10 total vacation days....so anything over that would be great).

So far, I've considered going into industry (I've been casually submitting industry job applications, but the biotech market is a tough place right now with a lot of layoffs), finding a staff scientist position at my current University, or a jumping ship from bioinformatics and being a science writer.

bioinformatics,"TLDR: I’m a 3rd year PhD student in a Population genetics lab in North America. I want a bioinformatics/computational biology internship in industry after my 4th year and similarly a job upon graduation (after 5th or 6th year). I have concerns that I won’t have extensive experience by the time I graduate. This is because I won’t get data I need for my main projects till the start of year 4 (infectious disease single cell omics projects). I’m not from a hardcore coding lab that mostly uses omic databases like gtex and gwas summary stats etc. I’ve had to do time consuming extensive fieldwork to generate my data. I have peers from dry labs who spend all 5-6 PhD years immersed in intensive coding projects. I’m worried that compared to them I won’t be as competitive when applying for jobs since I’ll just have 1-2 years experience. 

Background:
My first PhD project was on infectious disease epidemiology (long story)and I’ve become relatively good at R. I have experience with Unix,Python, HPCC from classes but I’ve never carried out an actual project with them. As a third year I’m starting to get self conscious of my lack of experience with analyzing/simulating -omic data. When I’m at meetings or conferences with other population geneticists I can understand the theory of their research but I get lost in the bionformatic jargon they talk about. I spent my first 2 years on my epidemiology project (completed) and studying for my qualifying exams. I am in my 3rd year and it involves a lot of fieldwork, data collection, reading and grant writing. I’m trying to figure out a computational genetics side project I can do but tbh I’m so tired after fieldwork that I don’t have the bandwidth. In my 4-5th years I’ll finally have data I need for my -omic projects. 

I know that I’m complaining and sound insecure but It’ll be nice to get some reassurance from people that might have been in this position or work with/hired people in my position. Unfortunately I don’t feel supported by my PI and he isn’t the kind of person I can talk to about things like this",Biology PhD Student: Advice Needed,1670449877

I work in a bioinformatics lab and will be starting my master's soon. When I first started working in the lab as an intern I didn't know anything so I asked a lot of questions (I have no prior experience in bioinformatics). But many of my colleagues that have been here for a long time didn't know the answers to my questions. As a result, I really had to study everything on my own. 

Even with something basic like DEG analysis (just using tools like DESeq or EdgeR) I always have something I am unsure about and no one can help me. For instance, my data had very different results depending on what type of normalisation I used in EdgeR. I asked my lab members at a progress meeting and no one knew why that would happen.

I feel like everyone just uses tools without knowing what they really do and when something goes a bit wrong, they just go with the methods that give the best results. Is this normal? Isn't knowing why we use a particular methodology supposed to be important? If I just tried a bunch of methods and went with the result that ""looks good"" is that okay?

The PI is way too busy to deal with the details (my lab has many departments and tons of projects in multiple research areas) so my colleagues and I are the ones that have to be responsible for the most part. The PI told me that when I use a tool or algorithm, I should know it well enough to be able to recreate it and run it myself, but my colleagues definitely don't do that. 

To what extent am I expected to know everything when the people around me don't seem to know? I feel like my PI is quite right, but nobody else seems to study deeply enough to do that. Don't get me wrong, my colleagues are all smart and probably way better researchers than I am. We also don't have much time because of the overflowing projects.

I am wondering if you had advice for someone who comes from a ""pure"" CS background and wants to transition to bioinformatics?  

Some background information: 

I am a former TT CS professor, and I recently rejoined industry in software engineering. While I like my job, software engineering isn't \*that\* fulfilling for me, and I miss being able to work on more complex and challenging problems.

I've researched job ads, and I'm comfortable with Python, R, etc., and data analysis/statistics/ML more broadly, but my research has not been related to computational biology at all. I recognize I will have to work much harder to gain that biology knowledge. I did take advanced biology courses in undergrad, so I have basic knowledge in genetics, etc., but my master's and Ph.D. went in a different research direction and obviously that was a very long time ago. 

Is it beneficial for me to consider certificate programs? Are those frowned upon or considered worthwhile? Do you have advice on which ones may be a better fit than others in terms of what employers generally are looking for and/or which ones are higher quality? 

tl;dr: Former CS professor looking to transition fields. Is this transition likely too impossible, given that I'm already early 30s and established in another field?

For a project ive been working on, i used CL ontology ([https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl) ).

The problem is that it is TOO specific, and goes into very deep cells, while in need to stay more 'up'. On the other hand, I still some depth, like CD4 T CELLS, Lymph Vessel endothelial etc etc.

If anyone has an ontology or even just a simple data or list that contain all the relevant cells, it'll really help me.

Need: funding for wet lab part of thesis (development of vaccine through reverse vaccinology with immunoinformatics pipeline)

Hello! My groupmates and I have our undergraduate thesis on developing a vaccine through immunoinformatics.

Our initial plan was, as the title has already suggested, to conduct it through dry lab, but our institution requires we perform wet lab, as well, which is why we decided that we would derive antigenic epitopes from isolated bacteria. That means we need microbiological reagents (agars, plates, etc.), a DNA extraction kit, a PCR kit, gel electrophoresis needs, etc. Hence, we need funding for this part of the thesis. I was wondering if you anyone knows where we could look for funding for our thesis. (I know that this group is bioinformatics but I still wanted to know if anyone had any idea where we could get funding for the wet lab part of our thesis). Any suggestions will be very much appreciated. TIA",Immunoinformatics thesis needs funding,1670154858

bioinformatics,"Hi everyone! Sorry if this question seems basic. I am trying to run the MAGeCK pipeline to analyze CRISPR knockout screen data produced by someone in my lab around 5 years ago. I was given the data as bam files and also have the sequencing sample statistics from when the samples were run including the number of total reads, aligned reads, and unaligned reads. I converted the bam files back to fastq files using

samtools view -h -F 2048 filename.bam &gt; tmp.bam

bedtools bamtofastq -i tmp.bam -fq filename.fastq

After converting the bam files back to fastq files, I ran the MAGeCK count function. I saw that none of the total reads matched between the MAGeCK count summary output file and the original sequencing statistics. 

More problematically, a few samples had significantly fewer total reads (like 50,000) shown on the MAGeCK count summary output files relative to the original sequencing statistics (\~44 million). As a result, many of the sgRNAs are not represented at all in the sample (there are \~61,000 zero counts relative to the total 77441 sgRNAs) which is impacting my analysis.

I've previously processed bulk RNA-seq data using hisat2/samtools/featureCounts. However, I'm not so sure about whether utilities like hisat2 can be used to align reads to introns (preferably without exons) and retain them for downstream analysis.

Briefly, my questions are:

1. Does hisat2 also align reads to intronic regions?

2. If this is the case, I was wondering if something like [bedmap](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/3289/counting-reads-within-the-intron) would be a good way to go about it downstream, since I would be checking for reads at specific introns.

Is it right to compare variances between replicates with variances between conditions? The number of replicates and number of samples are different here.

I would like to remove the expression values with a larger variance within the replicates relative to the variance across the 5 conditions. To do that, I find the mean expression value for each condition, before taking only the expression values with a higher variance between the mean expression across conditions than the maximum variance in each condition between replicates.

Unfortunately, that's basically where it ends. My GPA is pretty low (~2.86) and my transcript grades are basically up and down all the way from freshman year to senior year (the COVID pandemic started during the second half of sophomore year, and some unrelated long term health problems during my stay too, but I don't really want make excuses). FWIW I've done pretty consistently okay in basically... *only* my bioinformatic classes (B- to A- range).

As far as resume goes, I really only have my degree to my name, which I'm really disappointed in myself for. I studied under a lot of great instructors who are incredibly knowledgeable and have done amazing research in the field, but my grades in their classes weren't amazing and I never felt like I was able to get really close to any of them. Actually, I feel like I haven't really much networking at all, and I don't have anything really in terms of research/academic/work/extracurricular experience (unless you count a few R and Python workflows from class projects up on Github, but it's honestly just some basic stuff).

Obviously with all that a MS is basically out of the picture (not that I would have been able to afford it right out of school without scholarships anyways, and I think most MS programs prefer a minimum of 3.0 GPA for applicants anyways, right...?), so I was planning on doing entry-level lab and industry work stuff for around 1-3 years to build up some relevant work experience while maybe doing some non-matriculated courses on the side and then coming back to it later. Unfortunately, it seems like almost every job listing seems to want at least a MS to even be considered.

With most of the personal context out of the way: **realistically, what sort of jobs should I be looking for fresh out of undergrad with little to offer?**

And if you guys don't mind some other questions...
* Is relocating recommended or is it better to look for open positions near me? I'm in the Mid-atlantic region, but a lot of the jobs I'm seeing are all in Boston or CA since they're the biotech hubs right now. 
* Not as important since I'm basically just looking for any job at this point, but do you know what the approx salary range I should expect for someone of my qualifications (or lack thereof)? I was applying to various positions assuming it would something towards like 30k-50k USD max, but now I'm worried that might even be too high of an estimate.
* How do I know if my technical skills are enough to fulfill the needs of the position? Honestly, I'm not even sure what positions I should be applying to when almost all are either ""Masters required"" or ""Bachelor's required, Masters preferred"". 
* Has anyone else been in a similar situation as me? If so, could I ask to hear some success stories? It would really help reassure me a bit   :')

You can do a pilot experiment with really deep sequencing and simulate shallower sequencing by just discarding a fraction of the reads. But then what metrics do you use to decide what fraction would have been enough for future experiments?

E.g. you could look at:

* **number of genes hit**, but this will almost always go up as you keep sequencing, because you'll pick up rarer and rarer transcripts (which might just be artifacts)
* **number of significantly differentially expressed genes**, but this will also almost always go up because you'll gain statistical power for smaller and smaller effect sizes

Basically, i've just finished my MSc in Bioinformatics &amp; computational biology and i'm now searching for a job. Now i've got veeeeeery little other than my degree to show for and i'm wondering how to make the most of what i got to work with &amp; how to best present some 'not so great' gaps in my CV in a positive manner.  


1. The only work experience i've got is a 6 month temporary contract at the same uni-associated-lab i did my master's thesis in (and on the same project). However, the coding work i did for that job is... not in a form i would present to a potential employer. I'm not necessarily worried about its functionality (at least not more than the usual paranoia about uncaught bugs) but since my supervisor/boss did not seem to prioritize code cleanliness, readability &amp; reusability time was not really allocated for that. So i feel like i don't have anything to show from this time.
2. Before i started the BSc (biochem) &amp; MSc i ended up graduating in i also FAILED a BSc program at a more competitive (= 'harder') uni in electrical engineering and information technology. Since i'd say this is kind of a related field, i feel like that probably doesn't look all that great on a CV.  
Any chance this can be spun in a positive way (e.g. showing that i'm really interested in the intersection of biology &amp; IT or that the technical skills i gained from it, though not 'sufficient' for a degree, complement my biochem background). Alternatively, should i either a) mention this failed study program as discretely as possible in the CV or b) leave it out of the CV completely and only mention it when asked (i didn't drop out early but spent three years on it so i feel like its a gap that would be hard to gloss over) 

So basically, the only plus points i got going for me are 6 months of 'work experience' (but not 'in the industry' per se) and really rather good grades (though AFAIK that counts for next to nothing). On the other hand side i feel like both the gap of 'work i'm not super confident to present' and 'three years spent on a failed degree' are things i need to address with extreme care. Like ... they are PARTIALLY positive in the sense that i do have some (though not much) previous work experience and after the time spent on the failed electrical engineering &amp; Information technology degree i probably still have some extra technical knowledge compared to other graduates who went into bioinformatics from a purely biological background - but overall i'd say both of these things kind of look bad. 

Other than finding some coding projects to do in my free time and upload on Github (which i intend to do either way), does anyone have any advice on how to boost such a relatively empty CV and how to best brush over these potentially detracting points.

bioinformatics,"Hi everyone,

Background:

As part of a review on the potential of cellular enlargement as a new ageing factor our group manually went through thousands of abstracts and then hundreds of papers to find papers that reported a correlation between cell size and some aspect of ageing (an actual causal relationship has only been shown in blood stem cells last year).

So now I have a dataset of around 1300 papers that were hits, and another few thousand that appeared in our search on pubmed but did not report a correlation.

What I would like to do is to use the dataset to train an AI to do the same thing we did 1. For new studies 2. For other aspects of ageing that we did not look out.

The problem:
Some search terms returned a lot more hits than others (makes sense since how much size matters likely varies between biological systems). However, because of this I'm not sure how useful the dataset is actually in recognising ""things connected with ageing"" (picking up in ""cell size"" is easy since it is mentioned in all the papers)

I have limited experience with machine learning and none outside of some hobbyist fascination with natural language processing algorithms.

Any suggestions on how to help an algorithm pick up on such a multifaceted thing such as ageing would be appreciated. Also I am unsure whether my dataset is large enough for such a project.

Here is a link to our paper for those interested ([Cellular enlargement - a new hallmark of aging](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.1036602/full)). The dataset was used to construct Figure 3. 

Tl:dr: I have a dataset of 1300+ papers but it is a bit fragmented with how they relate to the topic of cell size and ageing. Can I still use it?","Automating literature review using machine learning, new ageing hallmarks",1669460695

Reading here and there, I understood that G=-KblogP(s), where s is a state. I assume that to plot these surfaces in unbiased molecular dynamics, I would compute the P(cv1, cv2) for every value of cv1 and cv2 observed in my simulation, i.e. just counting how many times a specific combination happens (presumably by histogramming to have some ranges), and normalizing, and then simply apply Kblog to each of these probabilities. Assuming that this is correct:

\- how specifically the probabilities are calculated, in terms of how the bins of values are defined for the histogram, and so on?

\- why using 2 collective variables, rather than just plotting the potential of mean force with one of them, or using three of them? in other words, why the 2D convention is so much used in the papers, rather than others?

I hope this is not a super-stupid question, and I will greatly appreciate if you could point to me where to find a tutorial for this - as well as some pedagogical material that I can use to educate myself (ideally, something that explains FES calculations in unbiased and biased biomolecular simulations). I find it quite hard to understand specific papers about this.

bioinformatics,"Hello,

I'm a aspirant PhD student currently involved in the application processes. As today I got rejected for the 4th time (once I was shortlisted and then rejected, the other 3 times I was directly rejected), some question started to come up in my mind.

1. How am I supposed to learn from failed applications?

Feedbacks received (after weeks/months of waiting) are usually something like ""Your application process ends here"" or ""You have not been shortlisted for the above position, so you are not among the candidates selected for assessment"". Now, I'm not expecting ETH to give me a detailed explanation on why my application failed, but I find it difficult to understand what went wrong.

2) Does being a ""pure"" bioinformatician represent a disadvantage?

Most of the PhD vacancies under the search term ""bioinformatics"" or ""computational biology"" regard both dry &amp; wet lab tasks. As I pursued a purely computational path in my career and have no experience with the wet lab, the positions that really suits my CV are very limited.

3) How much value do recruiters give to publications?

I feel like candidates with a publication are pretty advantaged. Fair enough. However I think, *with due exceptions*, publishing during the bachelor's or master's years is more a matter of being in the right place at the right time rather than being a better PhD candidate.  Although my CV has some strengths (highest graduation score, some individual projects in the portfolio and period spent on a quite known institute as an intern), I do not currently have a publication.  Should I spend some time in a lab to get one and then go back to PhD applications?

4) Does the Motivational letter really matter? Do you have any tips on how to write a good one?

I thought this was the most important step. I try to apply some guidelines based on what I find on YouTube or blogs. For example I write a specific letter to the institute I am applying for, rather than having a standard motivational letter used multiple times. However, I am afraid that given these multiple rejections, my letters are missing something.

I think I need to change something with my applications, otherwise I'll keep getting rejected.

1. Some bacterial reference genomes.
2. A collection of 50 something genes that are not homologous, but their proteins work together in a complex. for each gene I have a nucleotide and aa fasta that has it's sequences across the bacterial domain (dereplicated). I also have HMMs generated for each gene from these sequences.

Now, I have a hypothesis that some of these proteins might be in an operon. What I want to do is to visualise their loci along each genome and eyeball it.

I can use nhmmer with each HMM and then extract each gene's start, end, strand etc alongside the genome. What I'm not sure about is how to combine this information into a format that I can plug into an existing genome visualiser like artemis or igv so that I can eyeball it.

In practice, this means that the first variable of the model will always have the most explanatory power and one can fuddle their variable of interest by merely managing the order of variables.

bioinformatics,"Hello guys, hope you all are doing well. We have the opportunity to upgrade our server infrastructure.  Will be used predominantly for NGS (Exome + genome) data (No ML yet, but would like to keep options open).

There is no fixed budget to work with - generally the lower the better. For the sake of post, lets consider 10 lakh INR (\~12k USD) as the maximum budget.

Usage - There are 3 bioinformaticians who use the servers, mainly for processing research WES/WGS data, but also running analysis using different tools (For ex. to detect CNVs, kinship analysis, etc). We have hosted a HTTP server and a streamlit app where our lab mates (\~15 individuals) can access files and data. The server is running on RHEL7, main tools we use include bwa-mem2, gatk suite, annovar, etc.

We are currently using a server with the following specification -

&gt;Dell 2u server (Bought in 2016)  
&gt;  
&gt;Intel Xeon E5-2660 v4 x 2, 12 cores, 24 threads, totalling to 56 threads  
&gt;  
&gt;RAM - 378 GB  
&gt;  
&gt;Storage - 72TB mounted in 2 equal sized partitions, RAID 5 (6TB HDD x 13)  
&gt;  
&gt;Gigabit networking

We have roughly 5 TB storage remaining. We have \~3000 exome samples , \~40 WGS samples (all the samples have BAMs + fastq.gz files) and a bunch of softwares and resources. We try to remove intermediate files as soon as possible, but the server tends to be in use most of the time. We use OneDrive to backup the gvcf files (University email comes with 1 TB OneDrive storage, but this is just a spot fix) but BAM files aren't backed up any where. We plan to delete older data, ex. any data 3 or more years old. However, even such files are accessed occasionally when doing analysis. 

As of now, there is essentially one working copy of the data. Due to budget constraints, we would make a copy of raw data (fastq files) to 4 TB hard drives, catalogue the drives with VVV (good software) and retrieve the necessary hard drive in case we need any fastq files. I've been told I can delete the backed up fastq files from server, but I would rather not do that. We live in coastal regions and there is no telling how the external hard drives might (or might not) react to that.

&amp;#x200B;

My ideas are as follows - 

1. Use a NAS to store archived BAM and fastq files
2. If possible, upgrade server

There is a NAS model from Dell which might be suitable for our purpose, but quoted for 4 lakhs INR with decked out storage (12TB x 4).

So instead of just upgrading our storage, I'm thinking of retiring old server for storage + some experimental stuff and buying a new server instead.

&amp;#x200B;

The configuration I've decided is as follows -

* PowerEdge 750xs 
* Intel Silver 4314 (16C, 32T) x 2
* 256 GB RAM (which is eye wateringly expensive!)
* 1.2 TB HDD for OS, as just a 480 GB SSD was quited for \~600USD)

2. I don't have a third LOR from a professor, only from a professional one. I tried to get some positions this year by emailing professors from other universities but did not get a response.
3. I don't have a 4+ GPA (just slightly less).
4. My major is in Computer Science, although I did take many computational biology courses, as well as CS courses like ML and NLP that are going to be relevant in Computational Biology

LOR:

1. From the professor who is well-known in the field
2. From another professor with whom I published a paper - although he is pretty blunt as to who he will give his ""top"" referral letter every year, and I am sure it's not going to be me.

bioinformatics,"Hello everybody,

it's me again, bothering with another CNAs/cancer question.

I started working with cancer data, in particular with CNAs. Unfortunately, I do not have a strong biological background, and basically none in cancer. So, even after reading all the related answers I could find and more related papers, it is still have many doubts.I will try to list them for the sake of a clear exposition:

1. **How is the CN defined?** I'll try to explain. When detecting CNVs using read depth, what is usually done is mapping back the reads and then try to identify regions with higher/lower coverage then others. So, for e.g., in the case of a normal diploid genome, if I had a copy of a region only in one chromosome, by mapping back all my reads to the reference, I would expect to find that one region has double the normalized coverage of the others, so detecting that there is **1** more copy of that particular region with respect to a reference. In the case of a tetraploid sample, I would expect that if a region is duplicated in a single cromosome, I would still detect an absolute gain of **1** for that region. Is this correct?
2. **What are the relative and absolute copy numbers?** I found these different answers on the web, so I couldn't figure out. Taking into account the previous example, i.e. having a gain of **1** copy of a segment, would this be a *relative* CN? And if I knew the ploidy, how would I use it to find the *absolute* CN?
3. In my case, I would need to **compare the results** from multiple tools. Would it still make sense to eventually compare the *relative* CN, if I do not know the tumor ploidy?

Thank you in advance for any answer, and also thanks to evryone who answered my previous question, you were really helpful!","Absolute and relative Copy numbers, tumor and ploidy",1668600041

**The MAGPIE GROUP**  
The MAGPIE ([MAthematics, Genomics and Prediction in Infection and Evolution](https://www.sfu.ca/magpie.html)) group at Simon Fraser University is seeking applicants for dedicated **MAGPIE Studentships**, situated in the MSc and PhD programs in mathematics at SFU.

We are establishing a cohort of graduate students who will work and learn together, gain state-of-the-art training in the methods and interdisciplinary research skills in the group, and develop their own research paths. 

Students will join a vibrant and diverse research group with interests in genomic epidemiology, mathematical models in evolution, phylodynamics, and infectious disease modelling.

Our research interests range from fundamental questions about how and why pathogens evolve the way they do to applied work in collaboration with public health institutions on topics like COVID-19 transmission and the analysis of viral and bacterial genomes. Our research inspires new mathematical methods and tools, and new ways to analyze and interpret genomic data. We use these new methods to generate insights into how pathogens evolve and spread, in addition to more fundamental research on evolution. 

**Your Training and Your Future**  
Our graduate students will receive practical and theoretical training in infectious disease modelling, evolution, genomic epidemiology, and data science for infectious disease. They will have the opportunity to participate in a range of research projects and to work with our collaborating organizations in academia and public health, including the newly-formed Pacific Institute on Pathogens, Pandemics and Society ([pipps.ca](http://pipps.ca/)). 

They will be able to attend national and international conferences, workshops and hackathons, develop their own research programs and make connections outside academia.

**Funding**  
MAGPIE Studentship recipients will receive competitive graduate funding, anticipated to be in the range of $35–$45K annually, including a reduced teaching load, as well as expectations of substantial research contributions.

**Applicants**  
Applicants should have strong undergraduate backgrounds in mathematics or related subjects, experience with programming, interest in infectious disease and evolution, and a commitment to their own intellectual curiosity and how it can lead to an impact on our world.

**Information**  
For more information, please see the MAGPIE website at [www.sfu.ca/magpie](http://www.sfu.ca/magpie) or email [ccolijn@sfu.ca](mailto:ccolijn@sfu.ca) ([about Caroline Colijn](https://www.sfu.ca/math/people/faculty/ccolijn/) and her [part in the BC Covid-19 Modelling Group](https://bccovid-19group.ca/authors/carolinecolijn/)).

Basically, the assignment says ""we have a species of algae we want to sequence, and it's close to *this other species*""

I found the article describing the sequencing and assembly of ""*this other species*"" on NCBI and I can see things like its genome size, how many chromosomes it has, and how many genes.

The next question says ""Based on what we know about *this other species*'s genome, can you estimate the genome size of the algae we want to sequence?""

bioinformatics,"I don't see many compilations of technical tips and advice for people doing graduate degrees in this field and fields like it (maybe because I'm not looking in the right places) but I thought I'd share some things I learned during the degree I'm currently finishing because someone else might find them useful.  Knowing these things would have probably saved me weeks in work time.  


**Separate your data processing, data analysis and visualization scripts:**  
In my view the three major components of much of bioinformatics and data science in general is A. getting and processing your data, B. running your analyses and C. creating plots and graphs of your data and analyses. Since you might want to tweak each one independently (for me getting the plots just right was a Sisyphean nightmare, I work in python) you should be able to do each of those things separately by generating all the files you need as an output from the previous part and use them in the entry point of the next part. This way you don't need to execute your entire pipeline each time just to see if the font size change you just made to figure 7 looks better. This may sound obvious, but not necessarily to someone who never did this before.  


**Don't wait too long to ask for help:**  
You will inevitably get to a point where you need it. It is good to try to solve things yourself for the learning experience, but you also shouldn't let certain problems take too much of your time since there are many other things to do and learn and not too much time, especially in a masters degree. This refers to both asking your PI/colleagues for help but also other people. Don't be afraid to reach out to the authors of a paper (after running it by your PI if you don't already have his full confidence) and ask questions. The corresponding author will most likely refer you to the first author who will usually be happy to talk about the paper.   


**Don't try to generalize your code in advance unless you have too much time on your hands:**  
You may be tempted to make some methods or plotting functions more general than you need for the specific analysis you are currently doing, anticipating that in the future you will want to generalize (plot the analysis of an arbitrary number of datasets instead of just the one you are doing right now, have the option to change some of your model's parameters in the function call, etc.) but in my experience this is kind of a waste of time, on average. Unless your are sure that you will be using it (like if you are actually going to do it immediately after trying the simpler case) then it is safe enough to postpone writing more complicated code. You may be surprised at how often plans change and most of the time you will be trying out new things, rather than enhancing older analyses (that part usually only comes later).  


**Never, ever measure yourself against what others are doing:**  
There will be many other students with strong backgrounds in the things you wish you knew better, doing things that look incredible and make it look easy doing it. There will also be many students who will be struggling more than you. It is important to remember that everyone has different backgrounds, different opportunities, and different natural abilities. We may have different viewpoints on this but in my opinion everything is pretty much up to chance: You don't get to choose what interests you, how fast you learn, what projects you get (at first), how much motivation you will have 1 - 1.5 years into your degree (or even how likely you are as a person to overcome periods of poor mental health and low motivation - even managing to push through these hard times is an ability that some have and some don't). Even if you don't like the results you get or feel bad about your effort and motivation because others seem to be doing better, and even if the degree doesn't work out for you in the end,  you should feel pride in your hard work and the work you are doing to  push through because if you care enough to feel bad about it then you are probably already doing what you can. Take things one day at a time and remember everyone turns out OK in the end.  


Documenting your thoughts and things you tried: I know a lot of people recommend keeping track of what they do with a log or work manager, but I found it to be kind of hit or miss: All of my work was documented by definition anyway as code, and for me simply having a list of things I'm supposed to be doing in the next couple of weeks to cross off as I do them was sufficient - anything more felt like a bit of a time waste with micromanaging myself.

However, I did not find yet any post regarding a masters program where I might wanna apply. It’s called Molecular Techniques in Life Science at KTH in Sweden. I know, the name doesn’t sound like bioinformatics at all (molecular), and so did I think as well until I checked the courses of the program.
Well, it gets clear that it really isn’t a program solely focusing on bioinformatics, however, it especially targets people like me (B.Sc. In life science, in my case biochemistry) to get to learn bioinformatics and data analysis alongside other modules.

For example Genomics, Biostatistics, Comparative Genomics, Programming for life science (1-3), bioinformatics analysis of large scale data and some more bioinformatics related courses are taught, alongside more biology related modules as translational medicine and systems biology.

I was pointed to bioinformatics by HPC and snakemake/nextflow for scheduling tasks via slurm and later taking it to google cloud or AWS if I want.

I am running a bunch of neural networks in pytorch/jax in parallel and since this will (hopefully) be eventually published, I want to ensure it is as reproducible as possible. Right now, my environment is dockerized, which I have translated to a singularity environment. The scripts themselves are in python.

Here's my question right now, I need to run a set of models completely in parallel, just with different seeds/frozen stochastic realizations. These are trained off of simulations from a model that will also be run completely in parallel within the training loop.

Eventually, down the road, after each training step I will need to sum a computed value in each training step and after running it through a simple function, pass the result back to all agents as part of the data they will learn from. So it is no longer quite embarrassingly parallel, but still highly parallel beyond that aggregation step.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best way to do this efficiently? Should I be looking at snakemake/nextflow and writing/reading from datafiles, passing these objects back and forth? Should I be looking at something more general like Ploomber? Should I be doing everything within Python via Pytorch's torch.distributed library or Dask?

I have a cohort of patient and controls who have undergone whole genome sequencing.

A subset analysis of the PRS cases and controls with variants that qualified  for the monogenic hit show a near doubling of the PRS in cases over controls but the numbers are likely too small to reach statistical significance. 

My question is whether there is a method to see if the PRS and monogenic hits are statistically independent from each other.

We are sharing this three-part series on deploying a Data Science Platform on AWS using our open-source software. By the end of the series, you’ll be able to submit computational jobs to AWS scalable infrastructure with a single command.

The posts:

* [https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-i](https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-i) \- Use AWS Batch and test the infrastructure by executing a task in a container
* [https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-ii](https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-ii) \- Configure Amazon ECR to push a Docker image to AWS and configure an S3 bucket to write the output of Data Science experiments.
* [https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-iii](https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-iii) \- Use Ploomber and Soopervisor (our open-source software) to run experiments in parallel and request resources dynamically (CPUs, RAM, and GPUs).

AWS Batch strikes a good balance between ease of use and functionality. However, we’ve learned a few things to optimize it (for example, to reduce container startup time), so we might add a fourth part to the series.

If you’ve previously used AWS Batch, please share your experience. We’d love to learn from you!

bioinformatics,"Greetings,

A former molecular biologist here. 

To make a long story short: I have been a ""hands-on"" wet-lab person for all my years in academia (Ph.D + research associate). I really enjoyed experimental work. When I quit academia, I thought that I will be able to ""sell"" my wet-lab skills in biotech industry (or somewhere near the biotech), because I did a lot of work with protein purification and analysis. Unfortunately, it did not happen. It is regrettable, because years of hard learning were lost, but I cannot do anything about it. My current position is somewhat related to life sciences, but I am unhappy with it and contemplating a career change into something ""computational"".

To be clear: I understand that a bootcamp will not make me a software developer. I do not have a CS degree and have no interest in going back to ""school"". Right now I am trying to understand the ""landscape"" and find what can provide a reasonable ""return on investment"". I would like to get somewhat ""employable"", break into a new field and keep developing there.

Since I am a former biologist, the idea of ""bioinformatics"" came to my mind. However, looking at it closer, I do not think that it will work for me. As I understand, bioinformatics is a mature field now, there is plenty of specialized degrees (M.Sc and Ph.D's) in bioinformatics in top-tier universities, it does require a lot of specialized knowledge (CS plus hard-core math and statistics). As far as I can see, there is more ""informatics"" that ""bio"" in bioinformatics. Realistically, I do not think that I can make myself competitive by self-education (in my spare time) and within reasonable timeframe (1-2 years). I would love to hear your thoughts, though. 

**The second question is somewhat counterintuitive**: could you recommend the most basic bioinformatics projects that even an absolute beginner can do? I am badly missing experimental work in the lab and, unfortunately, I do not have even a back-yard garden or a mini-greenhouse! The only place where I can experiments is my laptop.",Is there such thing as a self-taught bioinformatician?,1667888694

bioinformatics,"Hi,

I am running DESeq2 on my data, but I am not sure what design model should I feed DESeq2.

My project has 4 variables: age, sex, genotype, treatment. We are mostly interested in the interactions between genotype and treatment during adulthood, but we have some untreated data at young time. Sex is just a covariate and we are not interested in it.

- Young  
  - Untreated  
    - WT &amp; Mut  (mix of Males &amp; Females in both groups)  
- Old  
  - Untreated  
    - WT &amp; Mut  (mix of Males &amp; Females in both groups)  
  - Treated  
    - WT &amp; Mut  (mix of Males &amp; Females in both groups)  

Following DESeq2's vignette, I've tried creating a variable ""modelVar"" = paste0(age,""_"",genotype,""_"",treatment). I have also tried several approaches:

- Use all samples together
   - design = ~ modelVar
      - Coefficient = Old_WT_Treated_vs_Old_WT_Untreated
          - UPregulated DEG: 27  
          - DOWNregulated DEG: 71

- Use all samples together
   - design = ~ modelVar **+ sex**
      - Coefficient = Old_WT_Treated_vs_Old_WT_Untreated
          - UPregulated DEG: 42 
          - DOWNregulated DEG: 84

[Some comments in previous similar threads suggested](https://old.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/ydfofi/deseq2_design_consideration/ittmu23/) to use only the samples of interest to remove extra variance from the model.

- Use **only Adult WT samples** (subset the matrix and metadata when building the DESeq2 object)
   - design = **~ treatment**
      - Coefficient = Treated_vs_Untreated
          - UPregulated DEG: 75 
          - DOWNregulated DEG: 134

- Use only Adult WT samples (subset the matrix and metadata when building the DESeq2 object)
   - design = ~ treatment **+ sex**
      - Coefficient = Treated_vs_Untreated
          - UPregulated DEG: 97 
          - DOWNregulated DEG: 178

Which model/approach should I use? Which design, and which data filtering?

We are mostly interested on seeing:
- Effect of genotype (WT vs Mut) in young  
- Effect of age in genotype (untreated) (Young_WT vs Old_WT,  Young_Mut vs Old_Mut). Maybe here I should do a age:genotype?  
- Effect of treatment in adult genotype (Adult_WT_Untreated vs Adult_WT_Treated, Adult_Mut_Untreated vs Adult_Mut_Treated). Maybe here another interaction genotype:treatment ?

I'm not 100% sold on using interaction terms. Although on principle they might look good, will they be easily interpretable? 
Creating a model with ""design = ~treatment+genotype+treatment:genotype+sex"" gives me the following results:
&gt; resultsNames(ddsm) 
[1] ""Intercept""     ""treatment_Treated_vs_Untreated"" ""genotype_Mut_vs_WT"" ""sex_F_vs_M""    ""treatmentTreated.genotypeMut""

If I understand this correctly, these factors mean:
- ""treatment_Treated_vs_Untreated"": Effect of Treated on WT samples  
- ""genotype_Mut_vs_WT"": Effect of genotype on Untreated samples  
- ""sex_F_vs_M"": effect of sex on Untreated WT samples?
- ""treatmentTreated.genotypeMut"": effect of Treated on Mut samples? 

So, to compare, WT_untreated vs Mut_treated should I do add up the results of ""treatment_Treated_vs_Untreated""+""genotype_Mut_vs_WT""+""treatmentTreated.genotypeMut"" like in a linear model?

bioinformatics,"Hello fellow bioinformaticians! I wanted to share a little bit of my experience delving into the world of bioinformatics with y'all. I think my story might resonate with people from non-CS backgrounds who transitioned into bioinformatics.

I recently just graduated from BSc majoring in genomics and bioinformatics. Although my degree might sound like I have a lot of experience in bioinformatics, in reality, my undergraduate course is more genomics than bioinformatics. We were barely taught any Python and R. My journey with bioinformatics happened mainly during the pandemic. Before the lockdowns, I was looking forward to doing lab internships and was so excited for it. Sadly the opportunity was gone when most labs closed down and a lot of undergraduate students were left stranded not knowing what to do for their internships. I went on to do my internship with a startup and eventually did a lot of coding for them. I had a keen interest in deep learning and developed some Tensorflow object detection models to deploy in a dotnet environment. I remember questioning myself if doing any of this would help in my scientific career. I was also slightly envious of my friends who managed to get internship placements in labs. At the same time I also felt out of place doing coding since I don't have a CS degree. I have a lot of friends who were doing CS in the same university and I always question myself if I should just give up on biology and just go fully into CS, which is probably a more lucrative option career-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to my Honours year where I had to carry out my own research project, the lockdowns were still there in my country. I had a very difficult choice in picking a research project since it was risky to commit fully to a wet lab-based project. I eventually did a heavy dry-lab project and well, I can say that I fell in love with bioinformatics and really enjoyed it! My project didn't exactly have a good basis tbh (a lot of conjectures) but playing around with public datasets and just using all the various bioinformatics tools out there, writing my own scripts, thinking about what each output means and how they connect to form my hypothesis. I just felt like I was doing science, except it's on a computer. I eventually developed a keen interest in bioinformatics algorithms (Ohhh gosh the book by Philip Compeau &amp; Pavel Pevzner is sooo good!). I think bit by bit, I started to feel like I'm not out of place. I'm a scientist who's solving biological questions, just not through pipettes and centrifuges, but through applying various methods of data analysis on large biological datasets.

&amp;#x200B;

So for those of you who are thinking of going into bioinformatics from a non-CS background, never doubt yourself or be intimidated by all the coding you have to learn. The challenge may seem insurmountable in the beginning, but you're not alone in this journey! StackOverflow is your best friend and there's honestly a lot of freely available resources that can help you. For people like me who are working towards a bioinformatics career from a science background, I think it helps a lot when we start looking at ourselves as cool scientists doing science on a computer! We don't have to feel like we'll never code as good as someone with a CS degree or feel like we're missing out on all the fun in the lab.

Overfitting is a condition where the model learns way too much. So the question arises ‘will the overfitting impact negatively the model?’ The answer is Yes. When the model has learned way too much, It means that model learns noise as well in datasets. It means that the model will perform well on seen(train data), but not on unseen data(test data). The following steps can be performed to reduce overfitting.

1. Clean data: Before proceeding with building a machine learning model, it is important to clean the data. If the dataset contains any duplicate features or unnecessary features which are not relevant to the use case, then the model tends to overfit as there is a possibility that the noise will also be learned. Hence, checking for features and having and reducing dimensionality is important in case of similar features or irrelevant features.
2. Perform cross-validation:  Cross-validation is another technique in machine learning that provides the method to solve the overfitting condition. Just like ensemble learning, cross-validation also divides the dataset, but the working is different. In cross-validation, training data is made split into several other train-test splits. These splits help in reducing errors in the model
3. Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to reduce errors by fitting the function appropriately on the given training set and avoiding overfitting.   
It is a form of regression that shrinks the coefficient estimates toward zero. In other words, this technique forces us not to learn a more complex or flexible model, to avoid the problem of overfitting.

 4. Ensemble techniques: Ensemble models are models consisting of multiple models or algorithms. Individual models can be combined through various methods such as bagging, boosting, and stacking. Ensemble modeling can reduce variance, minimize modeling method bias and thus decrease chances of overfitting",Ways to avoid overfitting in Machine Learning:,1673291148

I was wondering about the encoding/quantizing of meteorological information. I currently have wind speed estimation computed from satellite observations. I know that we have a RMSE of 1 m/s between this estimation and the true wind speed.

One issue I have with these data is their size: I want to try to be create as small file as possible to simplify I/O operations. Let's imagine several situations:

1. encode them on 8-bits data between 0 and 25.6 m/s, this means that we can't distinguish speed difference lower than 0.1 m/s.

2. encode them on 8-bits data between 0 and 51.2 m/s, with a minimal speed difference of 0.2 m/s.

3. encode them on 9-bits between 0 and 51.2 m/s, with a minimal speed difference of 0.1 m/s.

Solution (1) and (2) can be stored in 8-bits PNG files. (3) can be stored in 16-bits PNG files, but I'm confident the compression scheme would reduced the filesize quite well -though it is quite a dirty &amp; roundabout way-. This also keep the advantage than PNG files can be previewed in the file browser.

I am a student and have been very interested in the ways the bias can be removed from ML datasets, and I have some ideas of how bias could hypothetically be reduced but am by no means an expert. I would greatly appreciate any feedback, recommendations, or additions to some of the ideas that I currently have. 

Right now, it seems that there is no specific way to completely remove bias from ML datasets, but I have been attempting to create a hypothetical design or a process to prevent bias as much as possible.

First off, the quality of the raw data is really the most important part of machine learning datasets, but collecting good data is more of a statistical problem. Based on what the learning model is trying to do, you would need to consult with statisticians on determining the quality of the data and if it is even valid, and if you should be generating a random sample, or using all raw data. As far as the learning model itself, I have formulated a few suggestions for the dataset itself:

* One of the first ideas that came to mind is excluding 'sensitive' demographic data, like age, sex, race, etc, which may work in some instances, but could also backfire.
   * For example, one way of reducing bias is to use the demographics to pre-filter the data and ensure groups are accurately represented.
   * One thing you can do is create two datasets and run them through a machine learning model, one with the demographics, and one without, and then compare the results, audit for bias, and see if there is anything you can improve.
   * In some cases, it is also possible to only include variables relevant to the topic, but ultimately could be harmful as you lose more and more data points.
* It's also possible that you could pick a subset of the data to do things like, ensure minority populations were represented or alternatively create a dataset to represent each option, run each through the model with known outcomes, and evaluate and/or train it against itself.
* I also found that it must be necessary for there to be input and opinions on the dataset given by multiple professionals of different backgrounds to prevent any bias from the creator.
* Most importantly, there must always be frequent checkups to monitor if any bias has arisen and if so, ways that it can be removed.

datascience,"**tl;dr: want to switch to SWE because I enjoy programming more and feel unhappy with my data career experiences. Are my reasons valid?** 

Hi all,

I've been working as a data professional for about 4.5 years now and have been thinking about making the pivot to SWE for over a year, just have been spending my time learning more + building my portfolio. The reason is that I find myself enjoying writing code to automate things and create apps more than I really do linear regressions and analyses really. I also took some Udemy courses a while ago and really loved learning general python programming more so than I did a python for ML course.

I've also been feeling jaded by my work experiences too, which is also partly why I want to switch. I feel like the problem's I've been facing is that I end up doing a variety of random tasks because people hire a data person without really understanding what that expertise means or have unrealistic expectations from. I have done what I can to *bring* ideas and improve workflows to each place I've worked, but there are limits to how creative I can get depending on the organization. In my last job, I was in a data team with a lot of people who shared a similar background as me (masters or doctorate degrees in epidemiology or biostatistics)-these were very talented people, no doubt, but did not really have a formal programming background or data science knowledge outside of methods used in academia. I got asked to do a reporting task at my old job which was an insanely chaotic process done manually for years  by previous analysts (copying and pasting data cleaned into SAS into excel templates) with really terrible documentation practices. I taught myself enough R to fully automate this task-something that took more than 40+ hours a week, into ZERO hours. I also used tools like RMarkdown to create very professional looking documentation with explanations and code. 

When I tried to teach this to my colleagues so I won't be the only person doing this, it was going over their heads. I tried to use visual diagrams (flowcharts) and wrote every tiny detail in the documentation, which was unlike the minimalist documentation I received when I was given this task as a new employee. It still was not clicking. My colleagues admitted they don't like too much programming as a part of their job. I stayed on as a consultant for my team because these reports were considered critical and I would rather be paid than answer questions for my team for free. In retrospect, I regret this because the dependency on me prolonged longer than I expected. There was a new director of the data team who got hired and I showed her all the documents and told her I'm planning to end my consultancy now that she's hired. She told me a few days later she'd like to ""offer me an opportunity to extend my contract"" (?) to ""honor my work"". I told her I really don't want to stay on any longer and would like this work to be taken over. When I trained her on this stuff, I realized she had never used R, SQL or even knew Excel pivot tables. I don't mean to sound mean or pretentious about my skills because I too was somebody who didn't know this stuff at one time, but I also found it unbelievably unfair and felt a director should have at least some knowledge or ability to take over this work. I felt like my boss who hired people (not a data person) just didn't know the right skills required for the job. 

After my work experiences, I feel like I'm much more of a software person at heart than a data person, but not sure if I'm not giving data science a chance-perhaps my experiences may be different in a private/tech company?

datascience,"I've been chasing my tail for several years trying to figure out how to use real-time data from St.Louis Fed aka [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/).  The problems I've run into are somewhat technical but all have their origin in these questions ""What is a vintage date?  What is a real-time period?  When and how should each be used?""  I've asked FRED for help several times.  The last time they responded they gave me an explanation that is completely at odds with their own documentation.

At this point I've taken it upon myself to provide answers in the form of (more) comprehensive definitions.  

I am neither economist nor data scientist so from those perspectives I may be completely in left field.  I am a developer and from my perspective these definitions give me a consistent and logical way to understand the data. 


## Definition of real-time periods

The definition of real-time periods as stated [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/realtime_period.html): 

&gt; ""The real-time period marks when facts were true or when information was known until it changed"".

This definition is accurate but far from complete.  Specifically, it fails to identify several criteria that separate the concept of a real-time period from a vintage date. 

Real-time periods are:

•	A period of time when facts were true or when information was known until it changed.
•	Delimited by any arbitrary historical range of dates/times.  Real-time periods are unrelated to and unconstrained by any vintage date.
•	User defined.  Real-time periods are conceived by the user. They are not stored in any FRED database or computed by the API.
•	Not identifiers.  No unit of information that is available from the API can be identified by a real-time period by itself or as part of a compound key. 
•	Inputs to queries. Real-time start and end dates are compared to vintage dates to determine if a data element was valid during the user defined real-time period.

## Definition of vintage dates

The definition of vintage date as stated [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/series_vintagedates.html): 

&gt; ""Vintage dates are the release dates for a series excluding release dates when the data for the series did not change.""  

This definition is accurate but also incomplete.

Vintage dates are:

•	The moment in time when information is released.
•	Not arbitrary.  With respect to a given series, not every day in history is a vintage date.  Only the dates when new information is released are vintage dates.
•	Mark a moment in history when an event occurred and as such are immutable historical facts.
•	Not user defined - vintage dates are historical records.  Their values are stored in the FRED database.
•	Identifiers - a vintage date uniquely identifies a release of data for a given series.
•	Outputs from queries - Vintage dates are compared to real-time dates to determine if a data element was valid during the user defined real-time period.  If the vintage is valid within the real time period the observation is returned in the result set. It is identified by its vintage date.",Difference between real-time periods and vintage dates?,1673192108

datascience,"I've been working for four months at a startup now. I'm still in university and I will have to study for at least 2 more years. I work at that startup for 2 full days including one remote day. I discussed this with my boss two times and each time this was no problem at all. They asked me to come work for them and know that I have to travel much farther than the rest of the staff and have to deal with lectures and deadlines from my studies.

This Friday, because of deadlines I could not join the Friday drinks, I got a Whatsapp message from my supervisor that although he said that afternoon that I could work from home on Monday, my boss said that I did not negotiate that with him. That seemed odd because we did talk about it two times. 

This morning (Sunday) my boss messaged me that remote working is only for full-time employees and because of the fact that I'm doing research work, he wants me to work at the office at all times. 

For me, this does feel off, almost like a red flag. To me, there is absolutely no added value in coming to the office: no one ever asks me for help, the office is noisy and often people take up calls in the room next to my desk so I'm getting distracted a lot. The only reason I come to the office once a week is to have meetings and to talk to my coworkers. But, as I posted in this subreddit before, my boss is quite sexist and because I'm the only queer person in the office, a lot of jokes are made about minorities like myself and I really don't like that. I already talked about this with my boss three times, but it's not changing. I feel like I'm not really one of them.

Travelling to work costs me 2,5 hours extra per day, which I do not get paid for. When I get home from the office, I'm often tired and then I have to work at uni stuff in the evening. 

The upside of this work is that I learn a lot about AI/DS and that a new, female AI intern will start working in a few weeks whom I really like and I think I could learn a lot from here.

datascience,"Hello,

I've struggled finding good advice for my situation since it's very unique, so I figured I'd ask a large sample of people potentially in the field. 

I currently hold a Finance bachelors (graduated at age 21), for which I completed undergraduate research analyzing the effectiveness of a Trump-era policy. (Let me know if you're interested and I'll be happy to fill you in on the results.) Further, I have an Associates in Mathematics, which was really just an affordable way for me to add Calc I-III, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra to my resume. Further further, I've been programming as a hobby since I was 15 (now 23) and I've become pretty proficient with Python and MATLAB.

I worked in the Commercial Real Estate business for about a year before realizing I care about money FAR less than I had originally thought. I had always been interested in engineering, and worried I would seriously regret not pursuing it, so I'm now a Civil Engineer focused on stormwater and drainage. I know that sounds odd but believe me it's true, I was blessed to have people in my network who truly believed in me, and I've done very well at the job. Also as an aside, I've done Python for this company in ArcGIS to make scripts to automate their workflows. I say that because it's a good resume point.

Anyway, although I feel Civil Engineering is closer to what I want to do, I recognize that I'm ALREADY quite bored with it. This is a common theme of mine because I learn very quickly and once I feel I've learned the ins and outs of a career progression, I get bored with it. This is why I'm looking towards Data Science/AI Research. I want something with a high skill ceiling, and something that gives me a lot of new things to learn and discover.

My questions are as follows:

1. How accurate is my assessment that Data Science/AI Research is a high skill ceiling position? If I'm correct, which one (from reading my brief summary) do you think would be a better fit?
2. While I certainly have no domain ""expertise"" per se, I feel I bring a good deal of experience in the Finance (and engineering) business to the table. My lack of on the job DS experience and CS degree earmarks me as someone who needs extra training, which is certainly true; but I know I could be caught up to speed as a full time employee in about 6 months given my past experience and ability to learn. SO THE QUESTION: Are there positions/companies you know of who are willing to accept the risk of training someone with a non-CS degree? If so, who, and how can I find more positions to up my chances? Lastly, in your opinion, do I even have a chance?

I've completed extracurricular research projects outside of work/school which I've really enjoyed and have put on my resume, but I recognize my time commitment to work is hindering my ability to research more and to learn more data science techniques. This is why I wholeheartedly believe the best way for me to learn is to find someone willing to accept the risk of training me, as the learning environment of full time engagement cannot be beat.

|idx6|**1v3**|2v3|3v2|4v2|...|nv2|

I emphasise where the values change from those in previous rows. The format of the example values here is simply that 'nvm' means the mth value ('v') of column n.

Specifically, my application is a set of n quantities that are updating over time independently of each other, and I want to store the whole history of all quantities, the index being the time, i.e. it's basically a log recording when any of the values change, but they don't typically all change at the same time, only a few change at once.

A starting point might be to consider storing it as a csv with unchanged values being left blank:

```
time,1,2,3,4,...,n
t1,1v1,2v1,3v1,4v1,...,nv1
t2,,2v2,,,...,
t3,1v2,,,4v2,...,
t4,,2v3,,,...,nv2
t5,,,3v2,,...,
t6,1v3,,,,...,
```
When reading the data, the empty values in a row can then be forward-filled from the last time the value of that quantity changed.

The issue here is that for large n, that's a lot (n-1) of redundant commas increasing the size of the file, and the number of commas remains the same for each new row, even if only one or two values have changed.

Hence the next idea is not storing it as a csv to generate a table out of, and instead just including on each new line only those quantities that had changed with their new values:
```
time,1,2,3,4,...,n
t1,1v1,2v1,3v1,4v1,...,nv1
t2,2:2v2
t3,1:1v2,4:4v2
t4,2:2v3,n:nv2
t5,3:3v2
t6,1:1v3
```
the format here being that 'x:new_value' means quantity x has changed value to new_value. Assuming all characters and the column headings are 1 byte each, ths saves a constant n-1 bytes per row and only adds 3 bytes per updated value (column header, colon, comma) in the row, so the result is smaller in size as long as the number of values changing in each row remains smaller than (n-1)/3.

Is there any better and more efficient way than this? Overall, in addition to minimal file size, I'm looking for:
- a solution with fast appending of new data on the fly
- when reading the data, something that allows efficiently isolating both by time to see what quantities changed at that time (ideally without having to traverse all previous times to get there), and by quantity to see at what times it that quantity changed (ideally without having to traverse other quantities to get there).",Most efficient format for storing a table with repeated column values,1673120062

1. Offer 1: Axtria Insights (Life Sciences Consulting)— Decision Science Analyst
2. Offer 2: BDO (Accounting, Financial Services)— Forensic Data Science Associate

The pros of Axtria (Offer 1) is that I will be utilizing more machine learning and data engineering in my projects. I know Axtria is one of the world's fastest growing life science firms, and thus can provide me a good start in the life sciences vertical and could be used as a platform to get me into firms like ZS, IQVIA, etc.

On the other hand BDO (Offer 2) is located in a city I am much more fond of (where I know I will experience more personal growth), is a more established consulting firm (albeit in a different industry), and the work seems to be a lot more interesting— the whole idea of using analytics to help identify fraud on massive levels, working with some of the world's top lawyers, and being able to testify in courts sounds amazing.

datascience," So we had a task at work that wasn't assigned to me, but I wanted to try and practice anyway.

We received a table which contains 27,000 IDs that have a loan amount, term, contract interest and effective interest. Our task was to build a table that contains all the ammortization tables of each ID. So for example if the first ID has 12 terms, then we need to add 12 rows which contain the ID, loan amount, PMT, INT, PRN and term number. if the second ID has 30 terms, we need to build 30 rows, etc.

My colleagues decided to build a loop in SQL, but I wanted to try and practice it with python.

So at home, I built a dummy test data that contains 4 IDs which have loan amount, term, contract interest and effective interest.

I uploaded it to SQL, then calculated the monthly interest and added it additional column, then I calculated the PMT using numpy\_financial.

Next step for me, was to build a table that contain ID, INT, PRN and term and only after I build this table, I will calculate the PRN and Int, while adding the PMT via merge function. The reason for that was that I was using a loop, so I didn't want the loop to run too slow.

I built the table with the following code:

%%timeit  
df2 = pd.DataFrame(columns = \['ID','PRN', 'INT' , 'Term'\])  
for index, row in df.iterrows():  
for i in range(1,int(row\['Term'\])+1,1):  
    df2=df2.append({'ID':int(row\['ID'\]),'PRN':'','INT':'','Term':i},ignore\_index = True)  
df2

The code took 275 ms per loop for 4 loans that I uploaded. With 27,000 loans, it will be extremely slow.

\*\*note:the row in iterrows refers to the df DataFrame, which is the loans table that I uploaded. The df2 is the new amortization table that I want to build, prior to performing the additional required calculations.

I've been considering to start applying this year, but I keep seeing news about layoffs and hiring freezes, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.

Currently, our data/application architecture is like spaghetti.  Data flows all over the place through numerous complication integrations.  They do not know where data is mastered, where golden records are located or how to even view the data or what business processes rely on it.

This is obviously a very large problem as the organization scales.

datascience,"Hi all,

I've been working as a data professional for 4+ years now following a biostatistics heavy masters degree. I originally started out as a biostatistician thinking I wanted to eventually pursue a PhD to do research/teach, then went onto working in an analyst role in a government agency, where I started advancing my skills in R and Python, taught myself front-end dev too and felt like programming was by far my favorite part of the job and the skill I'd love to pursue with my career. 

Long story short-even though there's some aspects I like about working with data, the professional experience has left me frustrated and jaded. Biggest things being that everywhere I worked seems to not have a real understanding of hiring data professionals for, lots of ideas that seem sort of overhyped/overoptimistic, random ad-hoc requests that ultimately feel pointless, and the biggest one is the lack of clarity on expertise that's put me in situations where I couldn't hand off tasks since other data colleagues didn't know R, SQL, Python or Excel well.

I'm considering switching over to software (I know this isn't an easy transition and am working hard to prepare for it) but I've been wondering if I should try giving a chance to data jobs in tech-rather than hospital academia and government, which are the places I've so far worked in.

Long story short - I'm a data analyst for a small retail company. Very small data team (started 2 people, now 4 people). It was really great at first as I would get to touch everything data related (frim data viz to dba to small heuristic models to API development, etc.). However, as a result, I'm feeling stretched all over the place and unable to gain significant knowledge in any area (im slowly learning about each instead of rapidly about one).

So, I've started looking at the job market and found an interesting job - although one that looked too senior for my current status, and that paid 3x as much as I make (which seems too good to be true).

Its a senior data scientist job posted by this company called crossover - contracting for another company called Totogi. 

So, I applied for kicks and lo and behold, they screen using assessments (codesignal, english and a little quiz). Curious, I did the assessments and now I have an interview.

Now, I see awful reviews about them that date a few years ago (spyware on the computer for example). But the money is apprently legit, and from the job description it looks like I'd do a lot of technical work, which I enjoy doing, and hopefully helps me further my DS skills.

Before I waste more time with the interview or even take the plunge by mistake, anyone interviewed/worked for them could give me a heads up on what its like for a data scientist there? Or worked for a similar type of company? 

I mean, even if I lasted 1 year there, I'd make as much money as 3 years at my current one... I'm tempted if the work is actually beneficial on a resume (ie is good experience and not just grinding out bug fixes or data entry)

datascience,"Regardless of what application, I was trying build a model that attributed the total amount paid towards each payment stage. 

PREMISE:

We expect the customer to pay in four payments, where each payment triggers a different business processes:

30% deposit makes X happen
30% 1st payment makes Y happen
30% 2nd payment initiates the job full steam ahead
10% finale payment makes Z happen 

RULES:

The business process ALWAYS includes all four steps
All the steps are ALWAYS in the same order 
The percentages are ALWAYS the same
The Amounts due are different

QUESTION:

If for example based on our percentages-- 

The deposit will be $3000
1st payment $3000
2nd ""payment"" $3000
Final $90 

And the customer pays $7,000.

Instead of manually filling in each amount, I want the amount paid to automatically attribute 3k to the deposit, 3k to the 1st payment, and 1k to the 2nd payment. 

In Power BI, I had a ""IF (), true, false statement"" started:

Column 1
Deposit Due= IF([Amount paid]&gt;= ([Contract_Total*.3), 0,(Contract_Total]*.3)-([Amount Paid]))

Column 2
1st payment = IF([Amount paid]&gt;= ([Contract Total]*.6), 0,([Contract_total]*.6)-[Amount Paid]))

When I put in $7k it worked brilliantly with the appropriate ""due"" amounts coming out to $0 amount due in column 1 and 2. 

Even when I did $4k, column 1 would be $0 amount due and column 2 would be $2k (1k less). 

But something went wrong when I tried to replicate it beyond the first two payments/columns.

Data extraction is the process of retrieving data from a source, such as a website, a database, or a file, and transferring it to a new location or format. This can be done manually, by copying and pasting the data, or automatically, using a program or script to extract the data and transfer it to the desired location. Data extraction is often used to extract data from large, complex systems for analysis, reporting, or other purposes. It can also be used to extract data from one system and import it into another system, such as transferring data from an old database to a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some **steps you can follow to extract data from a source**:

**Step 1**: Identify the source of the data you want to extract. This could be a website, a database, a file, or any other source.

**Step 2**: Determine the format of the data. Is it in a structured format such as a CSV file or a database table, or is it unstructured such as plain text or HTML?

**Step 3**: If the data is in a structured format, you can use tools such as a CSV reader or a database query language to extract the data. If the data is unstructured, you will need to parse it to extract the information you need.

**Step 4**: Clean and process the data as needed. This may involve filtering out unnecessary data, formatting the data consistently, and handling missing or incomplete data.

**Step 5**: Store the extracted data in a suitable format for further analysis or use. This could be a local file, a database, or a cloud storage service.

I hope this helps!

Hi all, thanks in advance for your advice.

I'm trying to determine whether certain product feature improvements increased the number of monthly active users (active is defined as whether the user made a purchase in the last 28 days). We have the ability to A/B test but I'm getting stuck because this MAU metric is a moving window metric. If we run the experiment for exactly 28 days then I think calculating the impact to MAU is easy. But most of the time our experiments run for more or less days than 28 days. Below are a few scenarios to illustrate my point.

Note: All scenarios are A/B tests where we split our user base into equal treatment and control groups. So far, I've been calculating ""MAU Rate"", which is the proportion of users who placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment.

* Scenario 1: Run experiment for exactly 28 days. At the end of 28 days, simply compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order.
* Scenario 2: Run experiment for less than 28 days, say 14 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will include days from before the experiment started. If I use only the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for only 14 days.
* Scenario 3: Run experiment for more than 28 days, say 35 days. At the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. The issue is that this will exclude data from the first 7 days of the experiment. If I use all the days during the experiment, then I'm not really measuring MAU since MAU is 28 days and the experiment ran for 35 days.

Combinations are then linked to the probability of winning in a game (in poker it's called equity). If one player wants to bluff-catch given they have a blocker and suspect that another player is bluffing, then it can increase their equity if they decide to call. 

My question is: how would you visualize this effect in a fancy way? I have computed a list of equities for the situations when player have and do not have blockers/anti-blockers, but before plotting a bar chart I thought to listen for suggestions, I would like to make it more professional.",Visualization of blocker effect in poker,1672855921

I’ve been working as a junior data analyst for the last 8 months. 

The onboarding phase was really disorganised, I’d spend my time reading through documentation and getting familiar with whatever I could. 

I got my first project to work on around 6 weeks into the job. It was suppose to be just a dashboard but ended up being an automation piece so it was taken over by senior members in the team. 

My second project came along a few months later, but the data engineer has been having ongoing issues with the data being sent over from an external provider, so that’s been a blocker, but the data modelling and dashboard design is done. 

I was given a third project 2 months ago, a simple data model clean up and redesign of an existing dashboard, that didn’t take long and the dashboard is live now.

It is the new year now and I truly have nothing to do. The last 8 months has been me looking for work to do, I’ve asked to help out on other team member projects but they said they didn’t need it. We have a daily stand up where we give updates and talk about what we’ll be doing today. Today was the first day I couldn’t bs my way through the meeting and said I didn’t have an update. I feel really incompetent having nothing to do. It’s isn’t a fast paced company so there aren’t millions of things going on, and our data team didn’t exist just 4 years ago so the business doesn’t rely on us too much. 

Only 3 projects in the last 8 months, is this normal? If you currently work in data was your first job similar to my experience?? I’m struggling to understand why they hired me in the first place, I don’t think there’s enough work for an extra person.

**My background :** Master's degree in computer science. Double major in Aerospace and CS, with a minor in Business and Finance to be more precise, internships in aerospace systems architecture and business development. Good background in maths, but I would like to develop my DS and ML/AI skills.

**My Goal :** In any case, I would like to work at most 3 years in any of the following companies, in order to negotiate a better salary. Might be tough but I would love to have a shot at a FAANG company in the future. Moving in the US is something I strongly consider, within 3-7 years.

**Offer A :**

\- Compensation : 44k+ bonus and equity (expecting alongside 45-50k TC)

\- Scale up in the insurance technology : fraud detection (in e-commerce, healthcare, insurance). The company seems to have a product that gets adapted to the client’s needs (Saas). Valued at over a Billion.

\- Existence of a US branch if I want to x3 my salary in the future.

\- C# programming for solutions (so maybe more of an hybrid DS &amp; SWE role), SQL data pipelines. Fraud detection algorithms. ETL algorithms implementation.

\- A little stats and maths for clients data analysis and see if the projects holds up.

\- Very little machine learning from what i gathered (depends on projects).

\- Lots of client interaction (insurance companies mostly) and stakeholder management.

\- More working hours (40-50 range).

\- A lot of freedom (full / partial remote when feeling like it, the results are what matter).

\- Young team, full of energy that seem very pleasant from the interactions I had with them !

\- Maybe not that important but it seems there are 4 times more competition for this offer rather than the other one.

\-Offer really appeals to me, but idk if I will like coding in C# that much, might want to give it a go to see. And I would like a little more ML.

**Company B :**

\- Compensation : expecting 40k-42k TC, in a less expensive city.

\- A big aerospace company, within a branch developing Data Science solutions for Satellites (10 or so DS).

\- Mobility on other branches of the Aerospace company is possible. Apparently in other countries as well, though going to the US might be hard considering this is relative to national defense.

\- Expecting ML/AI and optimization techniques review. Talking with the various engineering teams in charge of the satellites (thermal, electronics, …) and trying to build DS/ML solutions to help them out, for exemple, predictive maintenance models that are with low calculation time. Implementation in python using tools such as Tensorflow and other DS libraries. Side projects on digital twin technology with R&amp;D engineers in the national space institute.

\- Not that much pressure (35h contract, can easily have Friday afternoons off)

\- Partial remote authorized, 2-4 days a week.

\- Evolving within a team that’s quite young, but a lot of lengthy administrative processes due to the size of the company. The manager would want me to fight alongside him in a couple years, in order to push forward data science projects to get better funds.

\- Salary growth is really regularized at this company and you should not expect big jumps.

\- I like the Aerospace industry, but dislike the long processes, and I am afraid to limit my opportunities to Aerospace DS roles taking this offer.

datascience,"I'm coming from a theoretical physics background. I'm just finishing my undergrad and can't decide where to go with my masters. I originally was dead set on going into machine learning. However, I looked into other stuff and thought data science seemed really cool too. I've always thought the types of stuff you can do and learn from data is awesome. I really like maths and have enjoyed a lot of the coding I did in undergrad. So then I because sure that data science was the way to go for me.

Coming to this sub, there seems to be a bit of a debate on whether doing a data science masters is even worth it.  I've noticed a narrative on this sub that doing a masters in statistics or CS is a better choice. I would like to work in an area that uses some form of maths, programming and data. That's why committing to just one of these three things has been a little troubling for me. I'm just not entirely sure what the best choice for me is coming from a physics background.

datascience,"So my bachelors is in architecture, and there's a pretty good chance I'll get into a top ranking university for the course Environmental data science and machine learning.

My question is, since I'll be self funding this degree, will it be worth it? It seems that the common notion is that there aren't many environmental science jobs and even less in the data science part of it, and that any work that has to do with the environment just won't pay well. Is it possible to get a well, non environment related job in the field of data science with such a degree? Or to jump into a UI/UX career as I would have experience with design (through architecture) and data science (through this degree)?

I guess I'm just curious about how narrow my job prospects would be with this specific degree and if it would be an automatic no for employers. If it matters, the modules aren't all environment based. Out of the 10 core modules, only the final project and the module Environmental Data specifically deal with the environment. The rest are all pretty standard programming/analytics modules.

datascience,"So next to my main job I have an internship. There, my goal is to transform their excel tools (basically spreadsheet where they manually paste information from different input .csv files, run a few macros, do manual data checks and so on) into a python script to avoid any manual input. The output - csv file used as input for some software. 

Now I am really strugling here. They have a material database built on excel. It has a list of materials and their physical properties. They key columns used for looking up the information have both somewhat standardized alloy ids, but also random part numbers (for when there is no alloy id), or text descriptions of parts. They say that everyone else in the company must follow these. 

Now, the input files come from different teams, and each input file, in the key column, has random information, differently than agreed typed alloy ids, maybe some random comments or something else. 

If been strugling to use their excel database for 3 weeks now. Whenever I want to join information from it to my input dataframe, I can not because it’s always a random text, or a different format, or something else. Everytime I get new inputs there is something new that needs to be worked around. 

So my question is - what do I do? 

Do I propose some kind of standardization and moving DB from excel to something more strict about the datatypes? 

Do I just keep building these workarounds for every glitch that ever comes up? 

Do I just leave that place? 

The whole company, apart from small IT dept operates on excel sheets. I was hired for paid internship for one of the non-IT teams to help them move away from using excel to coding data preparation tools in python, so I’m the only IT person there. Their main guy insists to get rid of all manual inputs, but everyone below him is not so keen to do that and whenever I say “for it to work we need to tell input providers to do THIS, and never do THAT” they respond “the world is not perfect, cant you make some exeption here so we can edit it manually?”. 

I’m going crazy here, I really can not keep making new fix for 1000 unexpected inputs that happened because there is no standard process, and then still leave it for them to fix it manually. 

Any advice..?",How do I approach this or do I just leave..?,1672772972
datascience," Hi, I am trying to look for a dashboard building tool which allows the sql queries to be triggered in real-time based on dropdown selection or parameter changes.  Currently we are using PBI but PBI requires preprocessed data.   I have looked into Superset/Preset.But they require the datatable to be ready and connected to each chart. And as per my understanding the real-time refresh is still dependent on data present in the tables rather than triggering new SQL query.  

I have previously built custom dashboard using Plotly Dash but I don't think it's feasible to build dashboard in that as it would need to handle transaction data which is in the form of NoSQL (parquet files).

It would be great to hear suggestion for dashboarding tools or DB platform which reduce dependency on the SQL server (DB platform) for processing the data.

Would also be grateful if someone can suggest an alternative to Rockset DB, as I am currently facing throttling issue while executing SQL queries, to resolve the issue I would need to purchase the next option available which is doubling the cost. Currently we have data in Cosmos DB as well but it's relatively slow compared to Rockset.  Trying to look for suitable DB platform in order to build real-time dashboards.

datascience,"So I just recently hopped into Kaggle Competitions to support some of the work I'm doing through my DS Degree program.  For the beginner competitions (eg Housing prices), I've been reading some of the blogs/medium posts about how individuals solved solutions.  I've consistently noticed a number of submissions doing EDA on training and testing sets.  Based on my understanding, this is a no-no but I don't know if I'm just doing myself a disservice.  

I was under the impression that the test set was a simulation of a production data  (which contains unlabeled data) and I would further assume that the goal is do exploratory analysis based on the training data (what you know)  with you'd have available at the time of model development.   I thought the goal was to make the best generalizable model based off training data (and whatever number of folds of that data is desired for validation) so that the model performs well to unseen data (which should be the test data).

I'm not sure if Kaggle promotes the use of test data in EDA, whether I'm just being too rigid in this viewpoint, or whatever.  That said, it seems like a huge disadvantage if I keep this strategy moving forward in spite of other kagglers  incorporating the test data into their EDA.  I haven't plunged into timed competitions yet but wondering if I need to adjust my perspective or live with the fact that this is just a thing people.

I have a technical degree from a 4 year good university which is already a good starting spot for me vs some other people online self learning. Ive done some coding in a couple different languages and im very analytical minded.

From my research online from some popular Data Analysis / Data Science channels I see that I can take the path of self learning data analytics on top of my degree with some online courses and make some strong projects and apply. Recommended online ive seen from popular channels such as Luke Barousse the following path:

\- Google Data analytics professional certificate for a good base

\- Learn SQL for Data Science by UC Davis on Coursera 

\- Excel skills for business specialization Coursera

\- Data visualization with Tableau by UC Davis on Coursera

\- Python for everybody specialization by U. of Michigan on Coursera

OR

I have the option to have an online masters degree fully paid for by my current employer except they are from usually for profit online schools as well as some non profits although when lookin up reviews for these schools people seem to trash them on Reddit (mainly because they are extremely expensive but thats not the case for me) these are the options:

&amp;#x200B;

my main question is what is my time better spent on? will the label masters get me further up the door when applying? the masters would probably take me on average 2x as long to complete as the Coursera courses and projects so I would only want to do it if it worth it. Im also scared that a degree from these universities arent worth much (especially the for profits) OR that it doesnt teach me what i actually need and then I need to take the Coursera courses on top anyway

datascience,"Hi, so this was me a few months back: I was interested in the field of Data Science and I still am so I started doing a lot of courses using R, learning about SQL, and many things related to data science.

But a month back I realized that I don't understand much about how the internet/websites works or are created. In these previous data science courses that I did, I just used to analyze and create models on already-cleaned data (which I now understand is not how it is in the real world ) but never understood from where and the processes needed to get this clean data and now understand that it is equally important to know this. Plus I also didn't know how websites are created, data is collected and added to databases, understand AWS and others which I feel is important to learn as well.

That's why I decided to take a step back to understand the fundaments before diving deep into a specific area. (I think this is really important for a non-CS engineer)

So I wanted to start this new direction with front-end and back-end development and then dive further into the backend related to data science/engineering and accordingly take it from there.

Here is how I've structured it:

\- HTML &amp; CSS

\- Javascript (Not looking to learn any frameworks atm but just to understand the basics)

\- Backend in either Node.Js or Python (Would prefer Python but don't seem to find any good course for it)

\- Figuring out the next steps...

So I've completed learning HTML&amp;CSS and currently doing a course on Javascript. I'm really learning a lot about how the front-end works and being hands-on with projects, even though I'm not interested in being a front-end developer I feel like it is necessary to understand and have basic skillsets in it.

Post completing this Javascript course is where I need suggestions/advice. My objective is still in the field of Data but now it is to have a good grasp of others elements indirectly connected to it as well before going deeper into the field of Data science.

Here are some questions that I have and would appreciate any help regarding this:

1. Does my approach and structure make sense? I am open to any changes that you think I should make.
2. Any suggestions on a good course for backend development in Python? I know a good course in Node.js but I feel like it makes sense to learn backend in Python just because it is more used in the field of Data Science and I can use it later on. I understand that I can pass on the learns to any language after learning the basics so should I learn backend in Node.js if I don't find any good courses in Python?
3. Once I do a course/s on backend development and understand how things work in the backend, this is when I want to introduce the field of Data Science to my learnings. So what should I now learn in the backend related to data science/engineering? Are there any course/s that I should check out?
4. What other topics should a person in the field of Data science know about that you feel people in that space generally don't?
5. Any important CS topics that I should learn? I will be learning Data structures and OOPs.

datascience,"Hi all, I'm doing my undergrad research on XAI for fraud detection. At the moment, we focus on transaction fraud (e.g credit card, and insurance claims), but we are open to other types of fraud as well.

After looking for existing XAI solutions, I have found SAS Fraud Management to be a very popular tool used by most big names in the industry. From their demo on insurance fraud, the main feature is a graph showing connections among entities (e.g accounts, locations, other claims, etc), contribution scores of each feature, and you can see past snapshots of the graph. The fraud analyst is expected to come up with an explanation from this graph.

I also came across Maxmind minFraud ([white paper](https://static.maxmind.com/34380a7d0315e590b2a2/js/marketing/static/minFraud-Services-White-Paper.pdf)), but it's just an API returning a risk score, and the heuristics included in the white paper are not easy to use to craft an explanation.

So far, I know that I can use SHAP to generate contribution scores, and GNNExplainer to explain a graph-based model. My questions are:

\- Is there any other popular and accessible tool for fraud investigation? (screenshots of the GUI are enough to be considered accessible for me)

\- Is there a guide for fraud analysts/data scientists for fraud investigation? What patterns do we look for in the dataset to determine that there is fraud apart from anomaly detection?

\- Are counterfactuals useful in fraud investigation? I think fraud analysts can benefit from being able to visualize alternative scenarios with counterfactual instances, but my professor doubted it

I'm working with a dataset where I am looking for anomalous/outlier values in one variable with several contextual variables (mix of categorical and continuous). From domain knowledge, I'm confident there is some sort of relationship (potentially nonlinear), but let's just say it's:

Target variable \~ Context A (categorical) + Context B (categorical) + Context C (continuous)  


I am looking for a way to identify outliers in the target variable *given* the values for the contextual variables. In other words, if a row of data has a rare value for Context A, it shouldn't automatically be an outlier, but rather be compared with more emphasis on variables B and C. In terms of data size, I have 100+ million rows and 6-8 contextual variables. It's a good data size for the largest categories, but not enough to just splice out by all the combinations of the categories.   


Most of what I've found online relates to ""context-dependent outlier detection"" but the papers are generally theoretical. Other unsupervised methods like isolation forest still focuses on outliers with respective to all variables, rather than a single target with multiple contexts. I've consider the possibility of building fitted models and checking residuals as a way of finding the largest deviations.   


Open to all suggestions for things to consider or to look up. Note this is a POC so anything of reasonable speed that can ultimately be scaled is totally fine. Thanks for your help in advance!",Contextual Outlier Detection,1672702005

datascience,"Hi all.

I want to add some new skills and I’m participating in a Data Science Bootcamp as you can see in the picture. I now that I’m never gonna reach the level of an experienced and we’ll educated data scientist butI have to get my feet wet in my business. 

I want to know what I need to add and wwhat I have to additionally work on after the bootcamp. I want to combine my experience in L&amp;D (Learning and Development) with data science to improve the employee experience and their development.

Some background info: 

I have a background in adult education and I was working as Sr Manager L&amp;D at a FAANG company. I have a Bachelor of Science and have strong knowledge in corporate culture and +10K hours of training and workshop experience. Now I‘m taking a few months of to recalibrate.

I’m getting sick of explaining that employee development is important. Nobody wants to hear it. There is never time for the people to develop. Only things that matter are KPIs especially regarding compliance. But this is only reactive thinking and working. 

Everybody wants great managers and the best employee retention in all departments but nobody wants to give them time to improve and develop their skills, because you can’t really measure the impact of training. 

Even if you train people in retail and the sales numbers jump the only improvement is a higher forecast 🤷‍♂️ fuck this game!

So I have to argue with numbers that I receive from dashboards that have been created by a BI Team that takes weeks to respond to requests and tickets. I want to work with the raw data, collect data and create predictions and models to improve the employee experience.

I’m starting with data science. I went through the course from Andrew Ng on Coursera. I know that this is just the surface and that data scientist are tough guys with phds in math or statistics and have experience in ML.
Well I can’t change where I come from but I can decide my next steps.

So everything you can share with me would be of value for my next steps.

In the picture above is the course syllabus. I’m also reading the books naked statistics, hands on machine learning with scikit etc., practical statistics for data scientists, designing machine learning systems and so on. I’m honest with you. I don’t understand everything in the books and need to reread the chapters and do more research on some topics. I’m also not a proficient Python programmer but I’m not afraid of learning this too.

So I really appreciate any support and help.

Thank you for reading and helping with recommendations.

In addition to the issue of spending a few dollars $$$ for nothing.

I did a quick search on the sub about specific online courses in the area, but I didn't find exactly what I was looking for. In this case, I ask for indications of paid or unpaid courses that are attractive to the job market.

Thanks for reading up. As you read, no hardcore background in tech or statistics per-say. Now here's what happened. In May 2022 I decided that I would want to continue my education and combine DS + PM skills to differentiate myself and build a competitive career. 

For context: I am married, have a mortgage and just had a child. Going back to school full time did not make sense. After looking around I selected a particular program (please do not hate me). Here's why I chose this particular program.  


\- I was able to study part time and complete the program in 6 months  
\- The program seemed comprehensive (happy to share the syllabus if someone would like to see)  
\- The faculty are practicing Data scientists and the  founder has a long footprint in the DS/Tech industry  
\- Multiple projects along the way to graduation  
\- Relatively affordable ($15K)  
\- After graduation - upon passing a test and if selected - placement as a DS intern in a DS consultancy firm to get experience in working on real projects (3-6 DS projects). I arranged to work on projects part time once I got to that point while continuing my full time job for the obvious financial reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**My journey:**  


I started studying 3-4 months prior to the bootcamp start date. Again, zero background in programming or anything tech related.  


\- spent two months on SQL  
\- spent two months on Python

&amp;#x200B;

Bootcamp starts. Initially I was fine and everything seemed to go smoothly and make sense. After 2 months as the program started to go beyond what I had already studied, I started to realized that the concepts were being covered at a very high level. There was no deep understanding or fundamental concept building. One week we did ""Introduction to Pandas"" and the next we were covering ""Advanced Pandas"". No. I do not want to half ass it and become an incompetent DS. I want to understand, grasp and apply the concepts. I need to know what I am doing. I want to have my fundamentals straight. I do not want to embarrass myself in interviews. I want to do this properly and competently.

What I decided:   
I decided to drop from the bootcamp and return in the future (have already paid). I plan to study on my own and get back in the program and use it as a refresher and then hopefully go get a placement and get some real DS experience.  


The Plan:  
\- Time spent studying up to date: 6 months ( 18 - 20 hours a week)  
\- Continue studying for the next 6 months ( 18 - 20 hours a week)  
\- Follow the syllabus provided by the program but take my time and self pace.  
\- I do not just watch tutorials but code along, work on guided projects and take my time with concepts/fundamentals.  
\- I plan to do a statistics focused course relevant to DS  
\- I am not looking for a shortcut (no pun intended) but do want to continue moving forward in my learning and career.  


I understand that I do not a background in statistics, CS nor am I PHD. I have to work with what I have but here I am - a product manager currently in the financial industry aspiring to work as a Product Manager in the DS field in the future.

I don't want to get a DS course and learn ( I did ), I can learn them on the go, what I need is gaining outlook. Is there any course, guided project I can learn when to use an algorith and why, when to use ML when DL, a class or a project that can make me gain skills to classify a business problem and create a method to solve it in the best way. Like in kaggle there are people at the top, so when they see a problem they must know what to use exactly, they even know which algorithm is more performant when there are multiple choices.

Other than that, I want to gain knowledge on general methodology of a full stack data science project.  Ideally again creating such a project. Is there any such guided projects? I don't care if it is advanced level. I have a CS + Math degree and I am confident.

I found those two in coursera, can you check their content and tell me if they are good? Also can you advice me other course, projects especially on gaining outlook about how to approacha  problem. I don't think that's something you gain by doing many project, yes you can learn that way but having an outlook would make me feel stronger and I would learn a lot faster.

Let's say we are doing an AB Test on two segments of customers. Segment (variation and segment are used interchangeably) A and B.   
We need to have a sample size of 8K per variation. 

We run our test and in the end we realize that there are 500 customers in segment/ variation A have moved to variation B and 500 customers from variation B have moved to variation A. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now you want to analyze the data. What would you do with these 1K customers?

It depends on the type of hypothesis that we have.

Otherwise, for instance, when I want to see what is happening to an attribute to certain types of customers, I would remove those 1K customers from both parts.

Backstory, I’m 32, dropped out of school as I had no clue what I wanted to do in life. Worked a lot of free lance marketing jobs in my 20s before moving to sales the last few years in mortgages and recently became an sdr at a tech company thinking I’d like it more but the reality is as an introvert, spending all day calling and selling is exhausting for me.

I always excelled at math in school and enjoy solving complex problems. I completed and got college credit for AP calc and statistics in high school. I’ve read data science is more math intensive and led intensive when it comes to coding which appeals to me but I’ve heard the opportunities tend to be better in software engineering.

 I would then get the future forecast range for these stocks (price prediction plus minus volatility prediction). If the range is fully below the current price with 95% confidence then I would remove that stock from my portfolio, if just the price prediction is below the current price then I would adjust the weight of that stock in my portfolio accord to how large the uncertainty of the future price is (volatility).

But I want embeddings of size 50-100 like glove. Is it possible? If it is, how?

I also have a follow-up question: If I am able to generate 50 size pre-trained embeddings, Is there any way I can generate a single embedding vector for sentence, considering only selective words in it?

for eg. sentence = ""I am having **headache** and also some signs of mild **fever**."" In this case, I want final embedding of size 100 (without any padding) generated from token embeddings (of size 50 each) of **Bolded** words. One approach I think of is concatenation but that will require padding in case more number of **Bolded** tokens present.

datascience,"Sort of a long, open-ended question, but I could use some inspiration, so please bear with me. For context, I'm a 34-year-old economics researcher who is currently in consideration for a promotion within my organization. We're a small, nonprofit research shop that mostly helps state and local government entities with economic and public policy research. It's a great place to work, nice people, awesome work-life balance, but it hasn't historically been managed well, and most of the management is older and knows basically nothing about the current state of data analysis. 

Most of the work is being done in Excel or other Microsoft Office programs, with some of the younger analysts (myself included) taking the initiative to automate some processes through coding. Even then, it's mostly R and Stata. We're affiliated with a major university and have access to all sorts of software licenses, but our professional development is so dysfunctional that it has been difficult to adopt new tools. I do think that should be getting better with some changes that are currently happening, but the consequence of years of this is that we are way behind. Wages are low for the industry, which makes it hard to attract or retain new people, but revenues aren't high enough to support much higher wages. Basically, if we want to take a step forward, we really need to improve our process so that this similar number of people can do more work with less effort.

With that in mind, I'm really curious what tools/programs/methods people and organizations are currently using that we should consider adopting in order to be a bit less antiquated. Some of the tasks which I could use some help automating/streamlining would include:  


* Data cleaning
* Identifying interesting patterns and trends within data
* Creating visuals (charts and tables) which display the data and showcase the patterns and trends
* Generating descriptive text around the data
* Forecasting future trends based on historical data

From the outside looking in, it seems like there are a lot of great tools that have been developed as of late to help with all of these things, but I'm so far behind that I don't even know where to start myself, let alone what recommendations to make to the broader organization if I end up in a position to do so.

The formula of each is:

Leverage(X &gt; Y) = Support(X&amp;Y) - (Support(X) \* Support(Y))

Lift has a range of \[0, inf\], whereas Leverage has a range of \[-1,1\].

I’ve always had an interest in data science and I attempted to start learning on my own 2 years ago, however, I didn’t see it through cause I lacked a good math background (I couldn’t follow some of the online courses).

Now I just got into this master’s program in a completely unrelated non-technical field, however my advisor has a strong statistics background and our research has a lot of statistics undertones so I’d be dealing with a lot of stat work.

Data Science began as a specialised branch of statistics to one of the most in-demand professions and the sexiest job of the 21st Century according to the Harvard Business Review.

One of the major players in the early history of data science was [John W. Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey). He was a mathematician and statistician who is credited with coming up with the term “data science” in the 1960s(a fun fact you might want to mention in your next Data Science Interview).

The mass adoption of personal computers in the office and at home saw the emergence of data mining algorithms, and the rise of new tools and technologies for data analysis and visualisation.

Personal computers made data analysis and visualisation more accessible and affordable, leading to a significant increase in the amount of data produced by society.

Data Engineers were born to build and maintain data pipelines to collect, store and process millions of terabytes of valuable data, whilst data scientists came to fruition to make sense of the data society was creating and transfer it to tangible business value.

datascience,"Hello,

I'm an individual with a BSc in Software Engineering and MSc Data Science who is building up a portfolio and trying to break in the data science field.

I wanted to ask users of /r/datascience what sort of tools (if any) you use to do the planning and track issues and TODOs with your personal projects (if any).

While my bachelor's degree in software engineering covered project management in part, but what I found lacking in my MSc degree was the planning and management perspective, specifically pertaining to data science projects (in contrast to software development/engineering projects). I'm curious to hear whether you think there's a difference between the two and what tools/tricks you are using or have used in the past to enhance your portfolio?

I'm a fresh grad so please take my question with a grain of salt - I do not have experience in the field yet but noticed the lack of teaching about project management techniques while I was writing my dissertation - I understand that data science is vastly more closely associated with statisticians and applied mathematicians who probably are not as familiar with issue tracking software as software developers are and perhaps fairly so, because while stats and math skills are mostly timeless, software tools for managing and developing software are not. Nevertheless my currect thinking is that projects in my personal portfolio would be vastly improved and perhaps more stand out by not only providing GitHub links that ""show off"" my data science skills but project management skills as well.

I want to incorporate data science into my career as a physician, but I'm not sure what the best way forward is as I haven't met many people who have been in the same position as me. Is it even feasible, given how busy medical careers are in general? 

I'm wondering if there is anyone on this subreddit who has been in the same situation, and is willing to share how they were able to incorporate data science into their medical career? 

Much appreciated.

**Shiny and JavaScript**

Shiny has become the status quo of building web apps/dashboards with R. A  major reason of its success is that you don't need to know javascript  to create basic interactive web apps.  

Although the concealment of this important feature is by design  and makes Shiny in the first instance easy to use, in the long run when  you want to build serious and more visual appealing apps, you most  likely need to utilize javascript to make most of the web framework.    

Learning  javascript doesn’t only benefit your shiny apps, the new acquired skill  set can be applied to other R web frameworks as well, such as OpenCPU  or used outside the R spectrum. Since javascript is the lingua franca of  web development, it means that you can use JS to create stunning user  interfaces (i.e. dashboards) for various other data (backend) languages,  such as python, skala, NET, ... 

## How to Get Started With Javascript

A frequently heard argument against Javascript from Shiny users or R  developers in general is the difficulty and the time consumption of  learning Javascript. Surprised to hear this coming from developers who  are familiar with a language (R) which is considered to be one of the  steepest language to master. The reality is that you don't need to  master javascript in depth to benefit from the language. A superficial  touch, enough to let a javascript library work, would be in most cases  sufficient  

Furthermore, there are many JS frameworks such as jQuery (a  popular framework used intensively in Shiny) that hide many  complexities, making JS easier to use and to learn.  jQuery is also  known as the ‘code less do more’ library

Moreover, even Yihui Xie  (auhor of the popular Knitr package), whose first task for RStudio was  to implement the JS library datatable in Shiny, admitted in a recent  blog that he didn’t have advanced JS skills when creating the package,  and was frequently copying code from stackoverflow. This indicates that  you don’t have to be a JS expert.

My personal experience is that  you rarely need advanced JS skills to get most of a javascript library.  Just like YiHui, you can use the following strategy:

1. If you  have an idea on what you want to implement in your Shiny app, search on  the internet for JS libraries that can assist in achieving your goals.
2. Having found a library that suits your need, read the documentation.
3. After  reading the documentation, look at the examples and use cases that are  accompanied with the library. You can try to mimic and play around with  the library on a playground such as JSFiddle    


Following these 3 steps would be mostly sufficient  to get started. If you need more advanced usages of the JS library, you  can use stackoverflow to explore questions and answers on the JS  library. Also, when you encounter errors / issues, stackoverflow is an  ideal place to find solutions.

## How to use Javascript within Shiny

Generally, there are 3 ways to get started with JavaScript in Shiny :

**Method 1. Htmlwidgets:**  
Htmlwidgets  basically lets you integrate libraries into the R environment, which  means that in theory thousands of JavaScript libraries can be used from  R. There are already some built-in widgets which you can use out of the  box in Shiny, such as the popular ""datatable"" widget that transforms R  dataframes into intereactive html tables. 

HtmlWidgets can be  considered as a wrapper around the JS library that you want to  integrate, making the communication between a JS library and R more  convenient.

Creating a htmlwidget follows the following conventions:

* Dependencies, these are the JavaScript libraries for which you want to write an R wrapper.
* R binding. This is the R function that you can call, and where you define the parameters, and how the widget is rendered.
* Javascript  binding, a Javascript function serving as a middle layer between the R  binding (R) and the Dependencies (Javascript). The data and options are  gathered from the R binding and passed to the underlying dependencies.   


To have a feeling of how to implement an htmlwidget, you can have a look at the skeleton of ""datatable"" at github.

**Method 2. Call javascript from Shiny:**  
 A big advantage of creating an htmlwidget is that it can be used as an R  package, which can be utilized outside Shiny in other R projects as  well. Disadvantage is that it takes time and debugging efforts to build  htmlwidgets. Another less time intensive way is calling Javascript  directly from Shiny via so-called callbacks. This process entails two  layers:

**2a. Session$sendCustomMessage** R function (sendCustomMessage) that outputs R objects to Javascript  

The session$sendCustomMessage(type, object)function lives in R, and contains two parameters:

* Type, a unique name of the callback.
* Object, the data you want to convey.  

**2b. Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler. The Javascript middle layer:**

Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler  lives in Javascript and serves as a middle layer between R and  Javascript. On the one hand it ‘receives’ the R object as passed by  Session$sendCustomMessage (see a), on the other hand it passes the  object to the javascript dependencies that you want to utilize in your  app.

Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type, JavascriptFunction), contains two parameters:

* type, the name of the callback as defined in (a).
* JavascriptFunction is the javascript function, consuming the R object.

 **Fictive Example** 

In  R we define a data.frame “df” which is subsequently conveyed to JS  for  each slider change event by using the session$sendCustomMessage  function:

    df &lt;- data.frame(klm = c(1:100)) observeEvent(input$slider,              {session$sendCustomMessage(""handler1"",df)})  }

In JS we consume the conveyed data.frame as follows:

    Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(""handler1"", hello); function hello (message){   alert(JSON.stringify(message)); }

So Shiny.addCustomMessagler lives in JS, passes the R  object “df” to the hello JS function, which alerts the object on the  screen.

Noteworthy is that communication between R and JavaScript  takes place through JSON. Hence, calling JSON.stringify to convert the  data.frame object from json to a string object.

#### Method 3. Send an object from Javascript to Shiny

Sending  messages from Shiny to Javascript is not always sufficient, sometimes  you want to enable the way around by sending objects from JS to Shiny.  This entails the following two steps:

3a) Shiny.onInputChange(id, object) lives in JS and conveys JS objects to R, and contains two parameters:

* Id = the unique id of the JS object you want to convey to R.
* Object = JS object to be conveyed to R.

3b) Read in R ,the JS object by referencing the unique id as defined in 3a).

Fictive example:

In JS you send the following JS message object to R when an action button is hovered:   

    $(document).ready(function() {   $( ""#goButton"" ).hover(function(){     var message = {id: ""id1"", data : [1,2], nonce: Math.random()};     Shiny.onInputChange(""GetJs"", message);   }); });      

In R you read the JS object as follows:

Meanwhile, I was contributing to my little GitHub repo, where I was re-implementing basic ML algorithms and related tools from scratch(Linear/Logistic regression, trees, neural nets, normalizations, optimizers, etc.).

datascience,"Hi y'all, first off, I'm an absolute beginner regarding statistics, therefore my probably trivial question.

I recently did an online survey, where people could list their personal problems regarding a specific topic and then ""weigh"" them individually, using a contingent of 10 points. (If they had only listed one problem, they had to use up their 10 points, thus weighting their only problem with 10 points, while other participants possibly had to distribute their contingent)

The goal of the survey is to find out the ""importance"" of each problem and then publish it. (each participant is equally or at least similarly experienced and can be considered an expert)

The problem is, that some people have listed completely different problems than others, in many cases, there is no overlap at all.

For example, the results look like this (""-"" indicating that the person has not listed the problem)

&amp;#x200B;

||Person 1|Person 2|Person 3|Person 4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Problem A|10|4|\-|\-|
|Problem B|\-|1|3|\-|
|Problem C|\-|2|3|\-|
|Problem D|\-|3|4|\-|
|Problem E|\-|\-|\-|5|
|Problem F|\-|\-|\-|5|

&amp;#x200B;

Simply taking the average of each weight for each problem feels wrong to me. People who have listed 3 problems, which may all be equally important, could have given Problem XY 3 points, while another participant who only voted on Problem XY  would have given it 10 points - thus ""skewing"" the average. (If I am wrong, please correct me here)

But how would I calculate it correctly?

Let's say we want to calculate the importance of Problem A, which 2 people (Person 1 &amp; Person 2) have mentioned,  four people participating in the survey. 6 Problems were submitted in total.

Person 1 has only voted on Problem A, thus rating it with 10 points. Person 2 has slightly more experience and thus voted on 4 problems in total, rating Problem A with 4 points.

My approach would be the following (e.g. for Problem A)

1. Check who has voted on Problem A
2. Of all those People, what person listed the most problems? (Person 2, 4 Problems)
3. How many problems did this person vote on? -&gt; It's 4!
4. Go through each person (who has mentioned Problem A) and calculate this:( Problem A Score ) \* ( Number of Probs. Person voted on / 4 ), thus receiving a ""normalized"" Score
5. Add the result of each person up and then divide it by the number of persons who have voted on Problem A (2)

In this case, the ""importance"" of Problem A would be: (see table above)  
(10 \* (1/4) + 4 \*(4/4)) / 2 = **3,25**

Problem B: (1 \* (4/4) + 3 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **1,625**  
Problem C: (2 \* (4/4) + 3 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **2,125**  
Problem D: (3 \* (4/4) + 4 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **3**  
Problem E: (5\*(2/2)) / 1 = **5**  
Problem F: (5\*(2/2)) / 1 = **5**

Recently at work, I've been muling over how there are many Data Analysts / Data Scientists both where I work and in the industry in general who don't have a good grasp for what it means to be competent with python.

I'm sure we are all familiar with the person who only uses jupyter notebooks, pandas, numpy, and sklearn. Said person believes they are great at python simply because they don't know what they don't know.

There's a few options I know of, but each have pitfalls:

1. Use the columns that create the calculated column.     Downside: often these values are colinear
2. Replace undefined with 0s.     Downside: this can skew the data toward 0 which reduces accuracy
3. Remove rows with undefined values.    Downside: Smaller datasets don't have this option, and even in large ones, undefined values could be a strong indicator

I've considered the option of converting undefined into 0s and adding a binary column that marks true for previously undefined values, but I can't find resources of that so I'm not sure it would be legit.

We discussed how RNN's work but not much preprocessing. Are there any keras preprocessing layers anyone would suggest? Speed detection is not really an image classification problem. I have at least split the video into an array of frame data using openCV already. This capstone seems very advanced compared to the instruction given.

datascience,"I am completing my data science undergraduate degree in the next 4 months. 

After graduation, I have a full-time Data Scientist offer at a well-known finance company. 

Also applied to master's programs in DS and expect to pursue my master's while working full-time.

My goal is to be a Principal/Senior Data Scientist in tech or fintech.

Quick Story:

I recently became very passionate about machine learning (especially NLP) as I had a chance to work on a complex internship project with a team of Ph.D. Data Scientists during my last internship. Before that internship, I worked as a Data Analytics intern that mainly did flexdashboards and shiny apps using an R programming language for the same company. 

Throughout these experiences, I noticed how programming was the main focus of both internships but had different scopes (DA vs DS). I think working with Ph.D. people influenced me to love machine learning much more than DA, as the project had more depth than any machine learning or statistics course I took at my college. It also forced me to do research and self-study stats and ML to deliver the project requirements on time. 

On the other hand, I saw how smart these Ph.D. people are, I don't think I can ever do a doctorate in statistics or cs as I don't possess the academic intelligence they do. In the future, I  want to work in the MLE/DS domain, but don't know how far I can go without a Ph.D.

During college, I did comprehensive internship projects in the ds domain which led me to have a very competitive resume. Also, my programming abilities led me to pass technical interviews much easier. However, in the future other people will catch up to my technical abilities and almost everyone will have their master's as well. What do I do and how do I keep improving as a DS so I won't feel like I stupid person next to PhDs?

I am open to advise and career tips from anyone. Since I have a good offer, am done with masters apps, and am almost done with my undergrad I have been thinking about what to do next to achieve my dreams.

I have been taking math (up until linear algebra and diff eq's), programming, and physics/engineering classes at a community college for the past several years because I wanted a different, more technical career. I fell in love with solving problems with math and did well in my classes, and am interested in furthering my studies in data science (but not entirely sure which area(s)). 

Initially, I wanted to get into a second bachelor's program because I don't have a relevant background and I thought hiring managers would want to see someone with a good foundation in math/science/programming. Secondly, I have a huge gap in my resume, so there is almost no way for me to get recommendation letters for me to get into any decent master's program (I prefer ones with in-person/live classes). That was a few years ago. 

Now when I read posts in this sub, it appears that it is more acceptable for someone to have an irrelevant background to go into a master's program in CS/DS. So my question is, would it be better for me to get a second bachelor's (in applied math or CS), or go for a master's in CS/DS (or preferably applied math, if possible.)? There are several GEs that I need to take for the second-degree program (which is a bummer, because I honestly don't want to waste time/money on those), but it is a very solid program at a good school, and I have the privilege to have been accepted and have the financial means to finish my studies. However, a master's will take a little less time and looks better on a resume. But I guess I am just worried about how it will look to employers because I don't have the work experience to go with the master's, and the internship/research opportunities that I can get as an undergrad seem to be more abundant (and forgiving for people who aren't necessarily skilled) compared to those available to grad students (I could be wrong).

datascience,"As we all know, Python is used in different ways by software and data engineers and computer and data scientists. The language is still the same, but the specifics change, as well as the tools and techniques one learns and uses.

I think it's somewhat similar to learning another language. In both cases you're still learning Spanish, but someone who learns it because his girlfriend is Colombian may do it differently than someone who learns it because he'll live in Colombia for 3 months.

In the first case, the person may want to learn intimate dialogue sooner, whereas the other person might ignore those and focus more on small talk and conversations they expect to partake in as a tourist.

So, with that in mind, my question is, do you think learning Python should be done in a similar way for us? I'm not even asking about learning from scratch, mind you, but more someone who wants to go from ""Beginner with a couple months of experience"" to ""Intermediate"" level.

Is it better to specialize our learning and focus on mastering data science topics (e.g. pandas, numpy, stats)?

datascience,"I'm an 18yo student currently in school in Munich, Germany. This summer I'll graduate and have to decide what to study.

It was always clear I want to pursue a career in a technical field, because I'm mostly interested in these topics. Especially Maths has always been my favorite subject in school (particularly analysis). The Physics and Computer Science classes are mediocre in my opinion. I never got into gaming or programming as a kid, although many of my friends really enjoyed it (and still do!).

Since programming was always around me in my childhood (my dad works as a Software Engineer at a mid-size company), and still is through my classmates often working on their app all night long, I thought studying Computer Science (at TUM) would be the right career path for me.

On the other hand, after looking into the Curriculum of the CS B.Sc. program at TUM, the only course I thought is interesting was Data Science. And actually, that's a right impression. I don't care about a new button size in some mobile app nobody's using, I'd like to analyse data in my job.

So, why should I study CS? At this point, I could just study Mathematics. The Curriculum of the Mathematics B.Sc. at TUM also looks a lot more fascinating than CS (more analysis, less transition graphs). The subsidiary subject would be CS tho.

My dream job is not working from home 24/7, but rather be in an actual office. Teaching is absolutely not a job I'd like to do. Also, I work for money, not for fun. My goal is to hit 100k until 30, but more is always better. That's one of the reasons I will probably emigrate to another country, but also due to the political/financial situation here in Germany (I speak/read/write fluently on German, English, Russian).

My dad thinks the idea of studying Mathematics is stupid, since you can only work as professor/teacher. He studied engineering in Russia in the 90s, than bought a home at 30, raised me/my sister and will retire at 65. This life is unavailable in our day and age. I will probably have to work until I'm 50 to buy a home, and retire at 70 with no money left (a slave life as Iman Gadzhi would say).
That's obviously not a good reason to study for 5+ years, I want to get paid very well for this kind of commitment.

This leaves my thinking about my further career choices. Is it financially better to study Maths and not CS go do Data Science, or does it not matter?

The 2nd one is image and text data, but I used vggnet and word2vec to embed both the image and text, concatenated the 2 vectors, and fed them into a deep neural network. So eye-catching ml with deep learning was involved.

My classmate says to go with the 1st since the feature engineering is pretty far more involved than the 2nd one (which I'll admit isn't wrong, as I'm just using pretrained stuff), and that the 2nd one, while impressive, is not business applicable.

Post-grad, I plan to pursue a masters in applied analytics/business analytics. The end goal is to become a financial data science consultant or maybe a financial analyst.

As my path is a bit unorthodox, I have been receiving mixed advice. One of my mentors works at a Big4 and thinks I should get a CPA and/or a CFA. My CompSci mentors disagree. I understand that neither are absolutely necessary, but the kind of role that I would like involves both business strategy and data analysis. Hence, I think it’s important to understand the numbers.   

If I pursue a certification, I would like to acquire it before grad school/going into the workforce. I’ll have my 150 credit hours prior to undergrad graduation and one year of experience, so I can sit for the CPA before my pursuing my master’s if I would like to.

datascience,"I thought I would make this post because I imagine that a lot of this sub is in a similar position to mine while searching for an internship in college.

First to start off, here is a bit about what is on my resume:

* Junior at a university with decent credibility. Studying statistics with a data science emphasis. 4.0 GPA.
* Worked as a data consulting intern last summer at a large accounting firm doing a lot of data engineering-type work. Used mostly SQL and python.
* Other work experience is as an advertising analyst for a large church, a linear algebra teaching assistant, and a data analyst at a start-up accounting firm.
* I listed R, Python, SQL, and Linux as languages I am proficient in. Also mentioned advanced statistics, mathematics, french fluency, and some soft skills.
* Some activities I listed were: data science club leadership, personal projects, and case competitions.

I would guess that I applied to around 120 internships. 10 of these were through career fairs and the rest online. Most of the positions that I applied to online were based in NYC or DC as well as remote options. I looked mostly for internships through ZipRecruiter, handshake, and LinkedIn. I also only applied to jobs that didn't state that they wouldn't accept CPT.

So here are my results:

* I did around 15 pre-recorded interviews as well as maybe 5 coding assessments.
* I heard back from around 30 companies saying that they were not interested.
* I interviewed with 5 companies.
* Ultimately, I received an offer from 4 companies for an internship.

Experience with each offer (from least to most exciting to me):

* The least exciting was with an advertising agency working as an ""analyst"". I just applied for the position through their website. For the pre-interview, they had me send in some basic analysis from some e-commerce data. I did one interview with a recruiter and he tested my basic problem-solving acumen. I then was asked to do 4 more interviews that covered a lot of topics but technical skills were not one of them. I received an offer for their Chicago office for $20/hour without relocation benefits. I think the biggest pro of this company was that it had a great culture. I definitely thought I could have enjoyed this job but it wasn't what I am looking for now to gain more data science experience. Ultimately, I didn't choose this internship because I felt like I would not get strong technical development. None of the people who even interviewed me knew how to code and some asked me what data science is. I also asked the recruiter how much I could expect to get paid if offered a full-time job and he said $60k which is significantly lower than I would hope for.
* The next offer came from a campus recruiting event at my university. The company is a large manufacturer of air conditioners. They interviewed me on campus and asked a lot of technical and problem-solving questions. I then did one more interview over zoom that asked about my SQL skills. I was offered $22 an hour, subsidized housing, and paid relocation. Although it was a good offer, I choose not to accept it for a few reasons. It was based in an area of the country where I was not interested in living and where I have no family or connections. Also, the work and company culture were not very interesting. I think I would have done a lot of menial data engineering tasks that would not have pushed my technical development.
* (These last two offers were difficult to choose between because I liked them both a lot) I applied to an event for a large bank on their website. I did a really simple coding assessment and they contacted me saying that I was accepted to the event. They flew me across the country and I participated in a hack-a-thon. It was really fun and throughout the event, each team had mentors that were senior data scientists that gave advice to the teams while also assessing our skills. A few months later, I got a call saying they would like to know my location preference, and then the next day I had an offer. They said that this offer was a result of my performance in the hack-a-thon. They are paying $45 an hour as well as a $2500 relocation bonus. The internship would be focused specifically on data science and artificial intelligence. I think I would definitely have grown in technical skills doing this job but after reading online some people's experiences at this workplace, it seemed that besides the fact that they paid well, people did not really enjoy working for this bank. I also already did a fintech internship so I think trying out a different industry would be really beneficial. I was excited to move across the country for the summer to do this internship but after not being offered any corporate housing, it was difficult to find affordable short-term leases. I definitely would have gone with this internship if I didn't get the other more lucrative opportunity.
* The offer I ultimately decided to accept came from applying online to a large healthcare provider. I did not hear back from them for a long time but then out of the blue, I got a call asking if I could interview the next day. I did a 40-minute call with a data scientist that tested a lot of my technical skills from coding to statistics. I then was told that I made it to the final round of interviews and did three back-to-back interviews in a two-hour period. The first was a more in-depth technical assessment with another senior data scientist, the second was a problem-solving interview by a manager, and the third was a behavior assessment by another senior data scientist. Almost immediately following the interviews, I was called by the recruiter and given an offer. It was a completely remote data science internship for $47 an hour. I really like the idea of working in the healthcare industry and a lot of the people I met at the company were really friendly. In all the interviews they gave me lots of time to ask questions and it sounded like the company culture was really healthy. I think the only con I had for this opportunity is that for starting out in a technical field, I feel like being able to work in person would help me gain more concrete experience. I overcame this thought, however, after talking to one of the team managers who assured me that I would be challenged and given tasks where I could grow my skillset. I also think that the flexibility of being able to work remotely and not have to relocate helped me make this decision.

The most fun question I was asked during the interviews was, how many golf balls could fit in a school bus? I have also received emails from companies asking if I would like to interview with them for other data science internships but since I accepted the healthcare provider's offer, I have declined to interview. This means that there could have potentially been more interviews and offers. 

I hope that sharing my experience can help other people as they try to find internships while still in university. I spent about a half an hour a day applying to 100+ positions over the past few months but all the offers definitely made it worth it.

datascience,"**TL:DR: I have a background in DS, but even as a 'Data Scientist', I do 100% DE work. Would like to move closer to DS. Don't hate my job, but losing patience. Feel like I've trapped myself and lost touch with my DS skillset. Considering building portfolio via Kaggle or similar, while job searching. Need advice on how to transition back.**  


Hey all, need some advice.  I'm early into my career, but I'm trying to figure out how to go forward from here.  A little bit of background. I have a BS &amp; MS in essentially information/computer science (not quite as theory/math heavy as CS, more application focused, but I digress), with emphasis in machine learning/AI for business problems. Basically, my knowledge might be more in line with advanced analytics (applying  existing models to new business domains) vs 'data science' (researching/making novel models), although I'm open and willing to be in the math heavy research side if the opportunity presents itself.   


My first work experience was as a data science intern on an internal consulting team were I was helping to build models and solve problems using data from various other teams in the business (where I was hoping to be with my current job). I was there for a year before leaving to try something on the business side of things (big mistake, hated that).  This is the type of work I enjoy doing the most.  


Fast forward a couple internships and I'm at my current job. I've been here for a couple years now (first full time position) as a 'data scientist'. I was here originally as an intern but converted. The original intention of the team, and my role, was to do data science/ML work in the traditional sense. Unfortunately, me and the other data scientists don't do DS work. My role has essentially transformed into a data engineering role, where I handle ETL pipelines for the reports that the BI folks on the team do. This isn't to say that I don't find value in my work and I do use related skills, like SQL. I don't hate it. But, it's frustrating that the one ML project proposal we've come up with keeps getting pushed back.. The 'promise' that was made a couple years ago just isn't happening, and it's impacting my motivation a lot. I think its time to move on.  


But here's my problem. I'm worried that my skillset has moved away from the type of work I want to be doing. I worry that I've locked myself into a data engineering career. This wouldn't be a bad thing if  I was an engineer working directly with ML pipelines. Then I would at least have some exposure. Even though my title and job description *is* that of a 'traditional' data scientist, I have no recent projects to speak on.  My resume isn't as impressive it should be for a data scientist 4 years into their career (counting internships).   


What should I do? I'm scared that the transition back to more explicit DS work will come with a pay cut (going from mid-level position back to entry-level), because  I have no recent projects. My core skills (Python, R, etc.) are weaker than they should be from not using them as much. My initial plan is to retouch on those skills and poke around on Kaggle, even the toy datasets, to show something. Otherwise, I've considered trying to get an IBM or Google DS certificate, but this feels like a waste considering I have a master's degree and grad certification in ML/AI.

We are seeing TTV ranges from 2 minutes to 15+ days, and this is not unexpected. It's long tail data, heavily clustered in the 10-20 minutes zone, and then slowly tapering off.  


The mean or median alone doesn't really tell us anything, because the data is so long tailed.

What metric can I use that will show if we are improving? I thought the mode and the interquartile range could work. A decrease in the mode would show that we are decreasing the hump of the tail, and a decrease in the IQR would show that the spread is also decreasing. (I chose the mode because it is typically the smallest value in a left tail distribution; all of the numbers are long decimals, so I'll probably need to round them.)

# Built for sensitive data collaboration

Collaboration between data owners and data scientists is a big challenge for highly regulated fields like health, finance, or advertising due to security and privacy issues. When collaborating remotely, data owners have to open their whole dataset, often through a Jupyter notebook. This too-broad access creates huge privacy gaps because too many operations are allowed, which enables data scientists to extract information from the remote infrastructure (print the whole database, save the dataset in the weights, etc). 

⚙️ BastionLab solves this problem by providing fine-grained access control. It guarantees data owners that data scientists can only perform privacy-friendly operations on their data and that only anonymized outputs are shared with them.

# How does BastionLab work?

BastionLab makes sure that the data owner’s remote data is never accessed directly by the data scientist. Three main elements ensure this: 

* First, a ‘safe zone’ is defined by the data owner to filter the data scientist’s queries, which enforces control while allowing for interactivity. 
* Second, expressivity is limited. This means that the type of operations that can be executed by the data scientists is restricted to avoid arbitrary code execution. 
* Finally, the data scientist never accesses the dataset locally. They only manipulate a local object that contains metadata to interact with the remotely hosted dataset - and data owners can always see the calls made by that object.

datascience,"It's brutal. When I have used ImportXML the first time, it looked like a miracle! I can retrieve data from external website *AND extract data from HTML in one function call*, wow! Now I am sick of it.

**Custom processing and conversions of data is painful in Google Sheets.** Let's say you want to import just 32.22 number from ""cost: 32.22 USD"" string extracted from some website. It is possible to do it in Google Sheets, with some fiddling around formulas and scratching your head, but obviously it is much easier to accomplish this task Javascript or Python, especially if you have lots and lots of data to cleanup!

**There is no proper launch and cache control in ImportXML.** There is no ""scrape now"" button in your Google Sheet. You can't control how often the ImportXML is triggered (well, unless you are a huge fan of Goole Apps Script!) and if you have many cells populated with importXML, it is very easy to occasionally trigger an avalanche of external http calls when opening and editing your sheet. There are also no caching mechanisms in Google Sheets, so if the last call to ImportXML fails, the cell will get *ERR!* value.

**ImportXML only works with basic websites** (no SPAs rendered in browsers can be scraped this way, any basic web scraping protection or connectivity issue breaks the process, no control over HTTP request geo location, or number of retries)

ImportXML just fails to extract data from a huge amount of websites for me.

I have finally found an alternative solution which I have been using for some time, it's more complicated to start but is just infinitely flexible and it just.. works for web scraping. My recipe consists of two ingredients:

1. Proper automation framework: I choose [Make.com](https://make.com/) because it is essentially a cheaper and more techy Zapier competitor, it is mature, and it works great. Free plan.
2. Web scraping API: I use [ScrapeNinja.net](https://scrapeninja.net/) because it allows to write custom Javascript extractors which allow me to extract any data from infinitely complex HTML of the target website, and convert it into arbitrary JSON structure for later usage. It has free plan. **And it can render SPAs like a real browser.**

So I have 8 separate spreadsheets, filled up with stock market trading data (backtesting),  and I'm stuck in professionally filtering and comparing the outcomes.  
E.g. in 1 spreadsheet there are data from \~700 trades that have taken place, with 6 diffent criteria noted down for each of them (including date, time, size of the market move etc.) To each of the trades, there are several outcomes percentage wise. (e.g. if it reaches a pre-defined level, I close the trade or if it reaches 1:2 risk reward ratio I close the trade etc.)

I would like to evaulate this data the best way possible. I'd like to see that how each result column depends on each of the criterias.  Basically, I want to compare the % of return based on a lot of existing data to see what aspect can definitely, statistically, produce a profit. 

 E.g. ""some criteria"" if &gt;=x then its 80% going to have a losing result. Alternatively, if &lt;=y then it will have a 60% positive result. 

 TL,DR: I would like to examine how the profitability of trading positions statistically depends on e.g. the size of the marke move, and so on, with 6 different criteria like this. And if this has been calculated, I’d need a summary of them altogether to see, that how each individually calculated and optimized parameter would fit with each other. This would provide me the final product, the best possible outcome from this data.

I tried to evaulate by trial and error, by just filtering them in Excel, then I got into pivot tables, which simplified it a bit, but still a huge amount of work, and just too much possiblities.   
Do you guys have any recommendations in terms of evaulating, or what software to use for this? Maybe Tableau could be better in visualizing the data statisctically, then cutting out the losing trades that way? Any recommendations on how to optimize, and compare the results?

Finally, I have the month-to-month values for certain data (eg: oil production), and day-to-day values for other data (eg: oil price). What is the best way I can adjust the data to make up for this discrepancy?

datascience,"I recently started working on a time series prediction and forecasting task, and the dataset that I use contains close to 700 features and only 4 years worth of monthly data points (just 48 samples). Part of my preprocessing workflow will obviously be to remove the multicollinearity. As a first starting point, I considered using the VIF before going onto other methods. After the first tests, I quickly realized that almost all of the features are flagged as highly correlated. I went on to further test this hypothesis by running correlation tests on individual features that got the highest VIF values, and found out that they were not linearly correlated to more than a couple of features.

This outcome led me to the question of whether VIF is dependent on sample size, and if the results would be different with a much larger sample size. I couldn't find any evidence to support this and the next obvious step is to test this hypothesis by recursively reducing a large enough dataset.

I figure I'll need to use Python or R if I want to apply an ML algorithm without implementing the whole thing from scratch, but I'll at least need to do some exploratory data analysis first to figure what features of the data look interesting, what algorithm might be appropriate, etc. 

 But how do I decide how much to do with SQL and how much to do with Python/R?  I've posted about learning SQL a few times this past week and I've gotten several responses saying essentially that SQL is nothing more than reading in data from a database and doing simple manipulations on it, like ``select`` and ``merge``, but also several other responses saying to be sure I learn more SQL than that if I want to actually have useful skills.  Obviously context is key and I figure there are some people who only use SQL for the basics and others who use it for mich more advanced stuff.

datascience,"I’m 27 - through my 20s I’ve had some industry changes, education pivots etc - but I finally found a bit of a niche in data science, if you consider data viz a vertical. 

I was hired as a data viz specialist this summer - finally fully getting away from my biz management background. I’m also a CS grad student (on and off), which also contributes to imposter syndrome (I struggle a bit). Anyways, in many ways, I’m still sort of entry level. 

I work in an agile environment with 3-4 data engineers, my boss is an ex sr analyst/engineer, and some salesforce folks. I just feel…stupid. They make these amazing things with data happen in queries, I just make it pretty dashboards and do some side admin work (notifications/comms). I get good feedback, I think I’m liked, and I’m the only data viz person remaining - I was an internal hire and we’ve tried 3 consultants to assist with data viz but were all canned for poor performance. So in a way, I am finding some stride in that I’m *the* person creating part of the experience for the end user. 

But then sometimes I feel capped. I’m not in SQL a lot. I have experience in Data Viz tools (Tableau, Power BI), but am mostly using a Salesforce equivalent. I do some light pseudo-SAQL coding (which I’m not sure is even great) but that’s it. I mean, a lot of my queries are sort of trial and error to get the desired output. It works, I’m not always fully sure why, I’m sure there’s a way to do what I did in 5 less lines. But I don’t know. I also manage the downstream dataflows, but that’s mostly simple joins and reporting to DE when a job fails. 

In some ways I’m learning…I think. But in others, I’m wondering if there’s growth in data viz. I love it. But it feels like I’m taking all the true work of the smart people and just doing the work they don’t have bandwidth too. Kind of like a designer and not a core data person. I could be wrong. Most of the time my boss has most of the ideas and I use them. I go back to other dashboards and tweak what worked there and move it to mine. I just feel dumb.

And then, what prompted this, is when I worked with the DE team the last few weeks. My only “data viz” equivalent is another consultant with like, 20 years experience, but he hates data viz and mostly hides in Salesforce tools and data management work. But even then, he knows a lot. We sync with data engineering on topics like data masking, AWS keys, object creation, schemas in tables…I’m just so lost. It’s above me. Sometimes I try to absorb as much as I can, others I just need not to learn something and overwhelm myself because I’m at peak capacity myself. 

But we talk, they solve it. I didn’t even fully understand what buckets are in AWS - dev, prod, etc. I feel like I’m quiet in meetings and let the smart people talk it out. Because I’m out of SQL, I feel like that skill isn’t as sharp. And we’re hiring another core analyst, so my focus remains on viz. and don’t get me wrong - I love viz. I think it’s sort of my niche - but I do want opportunity to do more, earn more, and more so contribute to my team and be useful. Right now it just feels like I’m running alongside everyone trying to keep up, but not fully “getting” these concepts of data work we’re doing. And obviously I don’t want to ask and sound stupid during meetings. And my boss has limited bandwidth and can’t just teach me things with all this time he doesn’t have. Even I. SQL, I do have the database but have no idea what to do with it. I was told to look into ROW_NUMBER, NOLOCK, etc - but still feel dumbfounded by simple concepts. 

This is mostly a vent. I just feel like a kinda not smart person benefitting from the work of great people, and being unable to understand these concepts. Yes I’m new in a way, but I want to do more and help more. And I’m just unsure what I’m doing is right or if I get all this feedback because honestly, the only skill I feel I have is just following direction",I work in Data Viz in my team and am feeling bigtime imposter syndrome around my boss and DEs/DAs,1671256429

datascience,"Hi,

First off, I am not here to downplay the effectiveness of resumes.

When you are looking for a good job, it helps to have a resume that helps you stand out from the competition. In fact, here is a [good Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z90g0x/i_am_an_experienced_resume_writer_and_editor_and/) around using resumes to stand out from your competiton here.

When used correctly, you can use **BOTH your Linkedin profile and your standout resume** to get the tech job that you want.

Much like your resume, your goal is to **create a great first impression** so that you can get the right tech job that you want.

**WHY HAVE an OPTIMIZED LINKEDIN PROFILE ANYWAY?**

* **Linkedin has consistently 1.6 billion in monthly visitor traffic.** (that is a lot of people who are actively searching for business and professional connections. This means that you have a lot of people that you can reach out for the right tech job.)
* **Linkedin has 810 registered global members** (In a global job marketplace where remote working is a growing mainstay trend, your job employment options are wider with more managers reporting higher productivity levels among remote workers.)
* **According to** [**Linkedin**](https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics)**, 49 million use the platform to search for jobs** (This means with an optimized Linkedin profile, you can stand out from your growing competition - especially if you plan to work remotely in the first place.)

**What I am here to discuss here is how you can:**

1. optimize your Linkedin profile to generate active conversations
2. use your optimized Linkedin profile to generate more Connections with your Linkedin profile.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are a few things that you need to keep in mind when:**

**OPTIMIZING YOUR LINKEDIN PROFILE:**

* **Create a strong Linkedin facial picture** (Use a very identifable facial picture where people can clearly see your picture. Smile, by the way. Your facial picture should be showing how you look like as a person.)
* **Create a clear banner picture** (You are missing out on a large opportunity to drive traffic to your Linkedin profile. Your Linkedin banner picture is one of the first thing that your potential employers or recruiters will see/present to your prosepective employers. Use your Linkedin banner picture to showcase specifically how you can be of a service. You can also use your banner picture to have more people message you by placing a call-to-action (""CTA"") so that people immediately know how to reach you.)
* **Know who your Linkedin profile is for.** (One reason that it takes longer to get the tech job that you want is because your Linkedin profile is usually broad and is treated like a record. With enough research, you can effectively target the right individual and tailor your Linkedin profile to that ""Persona"". This way, you can clearly communicate how you are of service to your potential employers.)
* **Keep all information relevant when it comes to appealing to right end viewer** (You don't need to list EVERYTHING but instead you can list relevant information that your end viewer wants to know. Today, within a hybrid/remote work environment, most employers are shifting their employees to focus on more higher-value work. Tailor your information to clearly address the proposed higher-value responsibilities that your employer is looking for. You can even create new information that tailors to the concerns that your potential employers has when it comes to hiring you directly.)
* **Organize your Linkedin profile around generating conversions** (This is key but the main point is that you use your Linkedin profile to generate more Connections - which in turn generates more conversions. Conversions are people resp)
* **Create external/native media that showcases your expertise** (People are lazy: you can exploit that from your competition. Experiment with Polls - so your content spreads to ""new"" Connections. Use short-form video with an in-video call-to-actions (share this video). When your potential employers see your video on your Linkedin profile, you can stand apart from your competition.)

&amp;#x200B;

*and* **GROWING YOUR LINKEDIN CONNECTIONS:**

* **Focus on generating conversations that transcend off on Linkedin** (While Linkedin is a great place for you to meet people, you want to move as many as those relationships to direct e-mail. Think of Linkedin as the public meeting place but the direct e-mail is the place that you can use to connect more intimately with your professional. This way, your messages are not absorbed into a sea of other messages. Plus, you have a direct relationship with your potential employer.)
* **Build an internal CRM** (There are tools that you can use to track your list of CRM. If money is tight, use AirTable to create a kanban board around a sales process so you can actively track where each employer is at when it comes to hiring you directly. With a CRM, you can actively prioritze which potential employer that you want to put more focus upon versus others. This also hastens the time between jobs or even finding a better fulfilling tech job overall.)
* **Actively reach out to your List of Connections** (You have Linkedin Connections. You should use them...not like a sociopath. However, you need to be starting Active Conversations. It may take a week or two to get a response but you need to build a habit of reaching out to your Connections (and new Connections) on a daily basis so that you always have fresh opportunities that you can always take advantage.)
* **Linkedin Sales Navigator is your best friend** (You can use Linkedin Sales Navigator to target the most active accounts on Linkedin. This hastens the response times that you will receive from potential Linkedin profiles. Plus, you have a rosterof new leads that you can use to generate new leads.)
* **Always grow your Linkedin Connections** (Shit happens. Always grow your Linkedin Connections so that way, you can always have opportunities on standby. Keep posting media that showcases your expertise. This way, you can grow your Linkedin Connections and have a rainy jar when your job ""unexpectedly"" goes sour: *a manager asks you to work in the office when you are super-productive in your own home*.)

datascience,"This is the question which is among roughly 20 others to be graded for a second interview. 

**2.** **In order to increase close rate, you instruct sales reps that, after each meeting, they should either (a) have a next-meeting scheduled or (b) call accounts every day.** **You** **decide** **to** **build** **a** **report** **to** **measure** **if** **reps** **are** **doing** **that.** **Mock** **up** **what the report should look like.** **You can use fake data.** 

 I have completed all the other questions besides this one because for one, I don't think the correlation of calling every day would net a positive result like the question insinuates and two, I don't think it's enough information in the first place to make a meaningful report.  Finally, I only have access to excel to make a report and I am not quite sure how I would use these few data points to reflect an impact on the closing percentage.  Am I missing something?

datascience," I have tabular data where each group of 100 rows represents a deployment of a specific geometry that has certain features measured. For example, I have 10000 deployments stored in a column called ""Dep,"" which ranges from 1 to 1000. When fitting this data to an xgboost model, the model may mistakenly assume that the deployment numbers have an ordering relationship (e.g., that deployment 1 is less than deployment 2, which is less than deployment 3, and so on). However, this is not the case because all deployments are independent of each other. On the other hand, if I remove the ""Dep"" column, the model will not be able to differentiate between the different deployment groups and their unique geometries.

I got the idea of one hot encoding of the column dep, but it's useless as the training dataset has 7000 deployments while the test dataset has 3000. If I do a one hot encoding, the shapes will not match (along with a slew of other issues). Better think of another approach.

Less features is more in this case so I’m wondering if there is any penalty I can add that is on the same scale as the scoring metric (eg accuracy for classification which ranges from [0,1] or negative mean squared error which goes from (-inf,0]) but based on the number of features.

I know there’s L1 and L2 penalty for linear models but I don’t think that applies here because if o square the number of features or something it will be largely out of scale with the scoring metric (eg adding a feature has a positive change in accuracy of 0.3 so let’s keep it, another feature only adds to the accuracy by 0.001 so let’s not add it).

datascience,"For context, I posted last night asking whether it's worth learning SQL if I'm only doing DS as a hobby, and a lot of people said there's more I can do if I know SQL.  So I'm willing to give it a try, but I don't really know where to start.  I mean, there are plenty of tutorials available online, but I learn best from doing an actual project and looking stuff up as I go (I'm not interested in doing a course on Udemy or the like because I hate learning from recorded lectures -- especially since I'm doing this for fun, because I like data science, I don't want to force myself to watch a bunch of lectures).  So I was thinking I'd find an actual database online with an interesting dataset, pick some project I'd like to do with it, and then find tutorials in to how to use SQL to extract, clean, and manipulate data, and use them as I go.  That's pretty much how I've been learning statistical coding in both R and Python.  

The problem is, when I Googled variations of ""publicly available databases"", I just found freely available data_sets_, the same type of stuff I'd find if I Googled ""free datasets"".  I figure there have to be actual databases available to the public, because otherwise how would anyone self-teach SQL, but clearly I'm using the wrong search terms to find them. 

Part of the problem is perhaps that I haven't had a course on what databases even are really -- I just completed a DS minor, but all the projects and assignments we did involved using R and/or Python to read in data from a CSV or XLXS file. I have a general idea of what databases are and I figured I'd learn more about them as I started using SQL (I learned about data cleaning and manipulation almost entirely from doing projects in R) but right now I'm very much a newbie to databases.

I am looking for feedback on an idea I'm working on.

It's a desktop application that will allow you to open the most common data file formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, Avro, Parquet etc.) and explore their contents in a nice table, you'll be able to search, filter, sort, group rows or run custom SQL.

From the table view you can also create charts and export them as images, or export a subset of the data as another data format, so you can effectively convert between data formats too.

In the future I might add some data cleansing features but for now it's just viewing / analyzing.

I’ve been working as a contractor for a small/medium-sized staffing firm for 10 years, on contract as a help desk/customer service manager at a large multi-national organization. Out of necessity, I started getting into data analysis, hit a wall with Excel, and decided to get a MS in business analytics. Now, equipped with passing knowledge of SQL and Python, growing intermediate R skills, some database management, expert Excel skills, and more than anything, a drive to make the business better, I’m trying to shift my position off of this contract, and more into my company’s headquarters operations as a lead data… person.

The most data-savvy colleagues I’m working with are very impressed with xlookups.

datascience,"\*\* Market Research for an idea \*\*  
Over the last 5 years I have worked for several companies as an Analytics Engineer (implementing tracking and tagging solutions) and Data Manager. 

My job normally included getting a picture of online and offline data and unite them. 

In each company I started auditing the different data and marketing platforms to understand the data structure, naming conventions and platform integration status. 

All of the companies I worked for had a big problem with old, cluttered and incorrect data.   
In one company we ripped out the complete tagging and tracking system and set up a brand new tag management system and platform end points (mainly Google Analytics, Databricks and some other platforms)  


In the other company I spent a very long time manually auditing the data and raising bug ticket after bug ticket to align data schema, streamline data endpoints and fix duplicated or broken properties. 

Even not being involved in one new website feature can mean derailing all naming conventions for that feature and headaches for any analysts or scientists who need to use that data further.   
I feel like this is a recurring theme in companies. Over time you get clutter or old data concepts that are no longer used due to team. focus or platform changes.   
I am currently investigating an automatic auditing solution for different data platforms, starting with the biggest, to quickly and easily get a view of what is currently collected and how.   
After this I would like to come up with automated platform enhancing tips based on best practices for that specific business (you are not using this GA feature, enabling this would give you x etc.)

You could also define conversion steps for different products/ areas of the website and see if the tracking is coherent or needs adjusting, simplifying the whole naming convention of your website tracking to keep it easy for analysts. 

 I would like to discuss with you if you also experience this problem in your companies and if it involves a lot of manual work that could benefit from an automated tool like the one described.

Our company cut its workforce by 33%, and our team shrank from 7 couples of working hands to 3. Most of the layoffs came after a long year of poor management and disconnection from evidence, which makes it even more infuriating.   

Besides the fact that now the current work will be divided among fewer people, I am sad that my friends got laid off, and feel lonely. In most cases, the DS/research team is somewhat isolated from the rest of the organization, making you an alien, having only three of us left, leaving me with very few people to talk to.  

I know it comes out a little funny that I am the one to complain after people lose their job.

datascience,"Title pretty much says it all. 

I have three coworkers  - Bob, Jack, and Jill. 

Bob spends most of his day asking people what they are working on where he then asks more questions with the intent of finding something he knows about so he can talk about it and essentially try to tell the other person how to do their job. Bob did this to me once and I told them to fuck off - they don't do it to me any more but plenty of people entertain Bob. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now Jack. I was recently put on a project with Jack and Jill and I work with Jack on other projects. Jack and Jill were writing code that is planned to be put into production and quite frankly the code base was shit but I never told them. I was asked to come in and extend the capabilities of their code base meanwhile Jack has done basically nothing since I have started on the project and Jill essentially only attends the meetings now. 

Today I was asking Jack about a portion of his code that gives inconsistent output for the same input and I asked him if knew why the API did this. Jacks response was basically telling me to add an if statement to his code to rerun a rejected request. More or less he dodged the actual question and averted to telling me to do some basic ass thing which I don't need him to tell me how to do; I'm quite confident that just about anyone with a pulse could come up with the same solution but it doesn't actually address the underlying problem and thus might not even be a solution at all. 

This interaction more or less summarizes the sentiment of my interactions with Jack.  Anytime I do good work to improve the code base he tries to claim credit for it in meetings and any time I ask him questions about the code he wrote his responses are deflective and generally shift into him trying to tell me how to code. I don't know if he is purposely being an ass or if he's just that aloof but it's really starting to get on my nerves. 

Now to Jill, Jill has two things going for her which are a language barrier and a superiority complex. We will be sitting in our weekly team meeting that she participates in where I give an outline of what I have accomplished, what I am still working on, where my work is going, and how it fits into the overall process map (which didn't exist so I made one). No shit, at the end of every meeting Jill basically tells me to do what I already said I was going to do except she does so explicitly outlining most of the things I already talked about where she does this with some new words for a twist. Maybe this is where the language barrier is a thing - I'm not sure but it's definitely annoying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind that Jill and Jack are basically the same level as me, we have the same roles / responsibilities only they have masters degrees and less than 1 years work experience and I have a bachelors degree with a couple of years of work experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've been on the project - Jill has basically done nothing but attend meetings and Jack, though he has done a slight amount of coding, has pretty much done the same. It's at the point where I don't even understand why our project lead keeps inviting them to the meetings / they keep showing up but that get's outside the intent of this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

To extend this further, I have noticed that in my org it's particularly common for the Data Scientists to walk around telling people what to do and that most of the work is probably done by 40% of the people where many of them just keep to themself.

My ideal career aim is to get into FAANG data manager role. There are many reasons I want to get into a managerial route but one of the key reasons is I'm tired of being an IC, leading multiple workstreams alone AND doing the hands on keyboard work whose complexity half of the stakeholders don't even understand. Plus ICs at tech have zero power/say

I joined my new role a few months ago for two reasons a) Opens doors to tech especially FAANG b) more opportunities to laterally move in data science adjacent roles like strategy or product manager
The con is I'm a small cog in a big machine and org is so huge it's impossible to create impact/grow or be visible.

Pro is : I noted in my interview process, interviewers are highly biased towards tech/non tech. If you're coming from non tech background it's harder to break into tech plus they'll definitely down level you

What's the best optimized path to get to my career goal?
Is it easier to slog as an IC for 2-3 years in tech and eventually get to manager or am I better off going back to my analytics manager role gaining more experience for a few years and then trying to make the switch

datascience,"Hey guys,

I'm a recent graduate from a Data Science Masters program with a few previous years experience in data analyst roles.  I'm on the job market but things are slow for now and I have a lot of time on my hands.  I'm thinking of developing my skills set and thinking Deep Learning (maybe through [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)) might be a good next step, but I'm not sure whether there might be other, better things to learn first as I have heard on this subreddit that most people actually do not use neural nets much on a regular basis at all.

I have a career as an analyst and have generally been more interested in delivering insights and driving business decisions than ML.  Over my graduate career I developed strong fundamentals in statistics, some ML, experimentation and linear models.  The linear models course I took at the end of school got me very interested in predictive modeling in particular.  I see a lot of ML-focused roles asking for experience with Keras and Tensorflow, and think it may be time to pick up deep learning.  Funny - I never pictured myself getting into ML and I think my heart is still in analytics and product, but it could really widen the range of jobs I am applying to if I start picking it up.

datascience,"Hey Reddit,  

My friend and I are building a project management platform for AI/data science teams (essentially a JIRA for ML). We aim to develop a data-centric, experimental tool that models the ML pipeline to organize workflows, building off the Agile methodology of software development. Our tool will allow ML engineers to design, track, and manage custom pipelines, data flows, and models all on the cloud. Below of a list of some features we plan to introduce:  

**Integrations**: Include a host of integrations to MLOps tools (KubeFlow, MLFlow, etc), cloud computing services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), source code management (Github, Bitbucket)  

**Iterations**: Allow multiple iterations within pipelines, and separate each iteration by various steps in the ML pipeline (business understanding, data visualization, data pre-processing, model training, model testing, model optimization, and deployment). Include a Kanban chart per each part of the pipeline  

**Callbacks**: The ability to request to go back to previous stages of the AI pipeline to either improve previous steps (like data preprocessing or model training/development/designing) or request other teams to improve previous steps (we refer to this as callbacks)  

**Storage**: A cloud storage solution to store ML models, datasets, or any other metrics/graphs/whatever ML engineers want to store.  

**Sketchpad**: A sketchpad to design data flows and ML models, and link them to code  Private Assignment: The ability to individually/uniquely assign tasks to different roles in a team, and the ability to be able to privately and specifically send vital information to specific people. for example, the pm could only send the data set to the data engineer, the preprocessed data to an ML engineer (potentially added on top of all this is a differential privacy layer), and send the packaged model to an integration engineer.  

**Chat**: A chat/communication platform to interact w/ your team  Quantitative Focus: ML is quantitative. The client wants QUANTITATIVE results. Hence, the epic should be emphasized on being quantitative rather than qualitative.  

**Experiments**: We redefine “sprints” as “experiments.” We make two changes to sprints. First, we DO NOT have any deadlines on any sprints. This is to not put the engineer under pressure. Secondly, instead of asking “what”, we ask “how” when asked to describe the experiment. This provides a heavily qualitative focus on the experiments, with a focus on function rather than immediate deliverability as in software engineering.

So, in my mind, I was prepared to work on New Users, the population of our model would be New Onboardings of Product A, and our target would be the Users that Cross Sell to Product B in a time frame since they acquire Product A. But they are not interested in this.

So base on the requirements of the problems, it seems more likely a Look Alike model, do you agree with that?

datascience,"BLUF: no degree but heaps of knowledge and experience in engineering, cybersecurity, and DS/ML.

I'm a seasoned cybersecurity analyst (threat hunter) and have been focusing on applied statistics, data science, and machine learning (classical and deep learning) for the past few years. I also am a full-stack engineer, which helps when creating tools and analytics. I've taught myself statistics and probability, linear algebra, and a little calculus, as it's necessary for fully grasping a lot of DS/ML frameworks and methodologies.

I've really struggled with imposter syndrome since I've started trying to break into data science and machine learning. It seems almost everyone has a masters (or two) or a PhD. Education-wise, I have enough credits for an Associates but didn't get the degree. I was working on a BS at the time, so getting the AS on paper didn't seem important. I'm extremely outclassed when it comes to degrees. However, what I do have is a considerable amount of domain knowledge, the ability and dedication to learn new topics, and a decent amount of data science and machine learning knowledge.

I've performed time series analysis (ARIMA, STL decomp, P/ACF plots, forecasts), built predictive models and classifiers (kernalized SVM,  decision trees, XGBoost/Random Forest), and have played around with GMMs, latent profile/class analysis, ICA and PCA, and t-SNE. I've also built a CNN and have built and used an autoencoder for anomaly detection. I mention all of that to demonstrate that I've gained a small amount of knowledge and experience and to get feedback on how that might stack up against other data scientists or other candidates trying to break into the field. I don't know how to showcase these particular KSAs without an advanced degree backing it up. I was able to pass both the Python and Machine Learning assessments on LinkedIn. The Python one had some linear algebra and data science questions, which surprised me. The Machine Learning assessment was a huge boost in confidence as an affirmation of what I've learned and how far I've come. It's laughable in the comparison and I would never bring it up in an interview, add it to my resume, or use it as a true credential, but it helped me out spiritually.

I'm not wanting to step away from cybersecurity, rather I'd like to bring DS/ML knowledge to bear on the longstanding problems within the industry, namely modernizing defender and detection capabilities. Right now, I largely work alone within a larger analyst community. I occasionally link up with some of the data scientists and machine learning engineers with the organization but I'd like to work closer. Trying to find that path really reveals my limited qualifications. Most positions have degree requirements that are at the grad school level and I can't compete in that arena. Could I make up for the lack of degree with certifications? Preferably ones that don't themselves have degree requirements (eg, aCAP requires a masters). If so, what certs would you recommend?

I'm in the blessed situation that my Data Science training has paid off and i now have some job offers to chose from. I write in hopes of getting some advice from some of you pros in regards which job offers i should accept. Mostly because the jobs seems to be in different ""clusters"" under the term Data Science. Its essentially a choice between:

1. Traditional Data-analysis in a scrum environment. Lots of data cleaning and exploratory analysis. Low pay, medium IT-skill.

2. Data-analysis oriented towards Business Intelligence including automation/ETL, SQL, PowerBI and more socially interactive in conveying results and helping non-analyst coworkers. Medium pay but higher potential, low-medium IT skill.

3. Straight DS including working in an Agile/Scrum environment, mainly doing analyst + machine learning to find solutions to a multitude of services in the public county. Low pay, high IT skill.

And then without job offers but still relevant there the 4th path: More SWE focused paths which includes more coding, having to either simple front end duties or learn about unit testing, data structures/algorithms and other languages but Python (C, java or the like). MLOps og MLE futures. Medium pay, high IT skill. Much for me to learn.

Since i don't have any experience yet i'm not sure which direction i personally prefer. I think i'm best off just getting any experience. But already now i have the choice to impact my DS career by which job i accept. However i think the business job sounds good because i will learn basic ETL, automation, more like all-around IT skills, but i'm also afraid of it not being technically advanced enough and i'll be stuck as a dashboard and simple descriptive statistics monkey that will always be a business guy. Then theres the more ""IT solid"" jobs that has a better IT infrastructure already, more technical coworkers, agile procedures, but whats the future in this? I will just stand on what others have built perhaps and not advance in regards to social aspects or domain knowledge.

So i was wondering if you pros knows anything about these domains? Whats the most solid choice? What would you do if you just started out? I know its kinda hard to answer without knowing personal preferences but its still a choice to be made and any wisdom is appreciated!

datascience,"TLDR: Need to recommend online courses to users. Recommending approach is unspecified. Don't know how the data should look. Don't know how to train the model. Don't know how to deploy this for production. 

Background: I have done work in NLP, images, numerical datasets. I have trained and deployed models to my REST API. I'm aware of CRISP-DM (Collect, clean, train, test, evaluate, deploy, monitor, etc). I'm just completely unsure on how to deal with this project. 

================================================================================

Greetings, I've just recently received a project from one of my clients in which they would like to develop a recommender system. The company is related to education. 

Thus, they would like to have a system that can recommended a list of courses to the user based on their input/personality/characteristics/etc. 

I've never worked on this kind of system so I'm a bit lost. What I have gathered is, in recommender systems, they are a few ways to go about this. 

The first approach that I've seen is called Content-based filtering. The second would be collaborative filtering. 

Content-based filtering is simply suggesting items that are similar to the items that the user is fond of. For instance, I like Apple juice, so it is possible that I might like Orange juice as well. (Hopefully my understanding is correct).

For collaborative filtering on the other hand, the suggestions are not based on the content/items, but rather on how similar the users are among each other. For instance, I like Apple juice, and a friend of my likes Apple and Orange juice. So, since we have some similarity with one another, he suggests me to have Orange juice. So, I'm guessing this is how collaborative filtering works. 

What I'm having trouble right now is, how am I supposed to go about this for recommending online courses? If I were to go with collaborative filtering, I would need a lot of users in my system. So, let's assume that there's not much traffic in the system as of now. This would result in inaccurate recommendations. 

If I were to go with content-based filtering, I would need the user to enter a few courses that they have enrolled before. I think..   


Both of these approaches have a similar problem which is called ""cold-start problem"". In which, I would need some input from them, in order to make some ""viable"" recommendations.

What if I were to make a survey, and based on their input, I would recommend them a list of courses based on what they chose? If I were to choose this approach, I can't see how the data would look like, or even how I'm supposed to train the model for recommending. On top of that, I don't see how I'm going to export the model and apply it to a REST API. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do let me know your thoughts regarding these approaches as well as my understanding on this concept. Thank you so much in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.  
If you have any resources that could assist me, do let me know. So far, I've seen examples of, entering a name of a course, and then recommending similar courses based on their name/descriptions.",Course Recommendation System (Experimenting with different approaches),1670765639

So I have this dataset where I’ve extracted all the words that have a shared meaning, and how many different languages that they have a shared meaning accross. I’ve then taken two lists of words with their affect value (-1 to 1) and arousal value same scale. And extracted all the word pairs with a value. 

So I extracted the top and bottom quartiles of the most and least colexified words across languages. 

I was told that a t-test would be a good test for my hypothesis but I can’t exactly figure out how to do that?  Would I be doing a single t-test and using what mean? The mean for the whole set or just the sample? 
Or a paired t-test?

datascience,"Hello wizards and sorceresses of r/datascience. I have come with a mighty question in hopes of a magical solution. 

Before I ask my questions, here's some background. I work on machine learning (ML) ""research"" (read ""fooling around"", nothing theoretical) as a hobby and lately I've stumbled into a challenge. I find it incredibly disruptive to have to wait many minutes between iterations of implementations of my ideas. Furthermore, the only time I have for fooling around with ML is between my dinner and bed time, so a 30minite wait is frustratingly long at that scale.

The current bottleneck preventing me from training quicker is the number of threads (16 threads on my desktop), and it cannot be parallelized via GPUs. The tasks, however, are embarrassingly parallel to some degree, so I could really utilize having many cores. Might be worth mentioning I've already cut some corners by working with a smaller sample size.

Now my question is, how do I reduce this my model training time so I can iterate over different ideas more quickly? Which Amazon Web Services (AWS; or other cloud services for that matter) would be suited for this scenario? I do have some money to spare, but I can't justify spending over $100 a month. For what it's worth, it'd cost about somewhere in the $200/month range for using 3--4 hours a night of AWS' elastic compute cloud (EC2) instance that matches my current desktop's specification. So that sort of crosses EC2 out of the candidates.

But here, they are quite expensive in contrast with the average income. It is what it is, so, if I start a master, I will have to take a long-term credit to pay it.

2) Not planning to stay in Colombia. I do not know when, how. But I will go out of LATAM. It is simple, I understand that I can get a good job here BUUUT still, not good enough compared with all the effort I’m putting in this. I will never be equally well paid here, then; let’s say, a 'a first world country'. If you are from LATAM, you'll understand what I’m saying.

3) Here, I am almost done with my Statistics career. True be told, I have learned a lot of statistics concepts BUT, in general; ML, Deep learning and so on, are terms that I have 'heard' about them but are not something that I had studied. Neither my academic 'career' (Degree. It is not the same here than in US, for example) or personal studies. So, ii have two options that are quite possible. 

I can enroll myself in a master and, somehow; there i will learn about... ML(?) Become a better candidate to a foreign company(?) I mean, i guess there is a potential that I’m not seeing in taking a master... But I suppose that, if I’m planning to live outside my country, i guess a master is an advantage. Not clear how. I’m just guessing...

&amp;#x200B;

Or... I can prepare myself with online courses such as, Coursera, Platzi and other online platforms where I can actually learn in a low-cost mode. I am thinking to take this path but, I lack a person who can actually guide me and give me a 'wise' advice. Is it correct to do this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about my profile... As I said, I am enrolled in a University in Colombia, I am finishing my career (less than a year to graduate) and hopefully, I will get my studies done. What studies? Well, I have studies lot of mats and algebra concepts, statistics concepts; that why I could understand almost ay topic with linear algebra and, if I need it to; I could understand how to manipulate data, fit a model, predict, etc. etc. So, could be better my profile? Yes. That´s why I am asking.  How can i make it better?

datascience,"""Transitioning from one field to another can be challenging, but it can also be a rewarding experience. If you are interested in transitioning from chemistry to data science, there are a few things you can do to make the transition smoother.

First, it is important to gain a strong foundation in the core concepts and skills of data science. This will likely involve learning programming languages such as Python or R, as well as statistics and machine learning. There are many online resources and courses available to help you learn these skills.

In addition to gaining technical skills, it is also important to familiarize yourself with the data science field and the types of problems that data scientists typically work on. Reading articles, attending conferences, and networking with other data scientists can help you learn more about the field and identify areas where your chemistry background may be particularly valuable.

Once you have developed a strong foundation in data science, it may be helpful to look for internships or entry-level positions that can provide you with hands-on experience and help you build your professional network. As you gain experience, you may find that your chemistry background is an asset in certain areas of data science, such as drug discovery or materials science.

I am a new data scientist without a strong software engineering background. I am the only data scientist at my company, and the only person who writes code other than a few people in our IT department, but they focus mainly on our ERP system and our databases. 

Most of the project that I am working on go something like this. ""We want to create a software tool that does X (forecasting, modeling, etc. Data science stuff)"". Then on my own, I figure out how to ""do"" it, and start coding. As I work, my code base gets more convoluted.

To address this, I've taken a software engineering 101 course on Udemy, and it was helpful for the ""planning"" phase. I.e. spend more time up front gathering requirements and turning them into specifications. However I haven't found any good resources for how to ""structure"" my code base at a high level. 

Can anyone provide any references where I can learn some of these best practices? 

To be clear, I'm not asking you guys/gals to answer these for me (although I'd appreciate the advice). I'm wondering if you know of any good learning tools that would teach these things. I'm happy to take courses if available but haven't been able to find one.

For example: 

1. Should I have a separate .py file where I define all of my functions, or should I define them in the script in which they will be used?
2. Although it may change greatly project to project, is there a best practice set of guidelines I should follow to set up my folder structure? i.e. an input data folder, an output data folder, etc?
3. How can I schedule my program to run every month so I don't have to do it manually?
4. So far, I have set up individual Anaconda virtual environments for each project, and doing all dev in Spyder. Does this mean that only I can run the script from my computer? Is there a better way to create a project with all required packages so that anyone can run it without them needing Anaconda installed?
5. Should I have a 'requirements.txt' file? What should be in it?
6. Should I have a 'utils'txt' file? What should be in it?
7. Should I have different .py scripts that do different things, and call them in series? Or should I have one '[main.py](https://main.py)' script that does everything and only call that?
