bioinformatics,"Hi all,

I am planning on running a microarray metanalysis on a number of datasets, however the raw CEL files for all of these are not available. When I have run a microarray metanalysis in the past I have always started from raw CEL files and performed the same normalisations etc on all datasets rather than using the series matrix files available from GEO (which I understand to be summaries of the experiment including normalisation etc performed by the original authors of the study). 

I would still like to be able to run this metanalysis, but as not all raw data files are available I was wondering what people's opinions on using series matrix files would be instead? As far as I can see, there could be issues with not all data sets having the same normalisation, but also this may increase reproducibility if I used these pre-existing files.

bioinformatics,"Hello, 

I've been looking at some refseq records and have come across some incomplete CDS annotations.  However, I'm slightly confused as to how they got picked up, given they seem to lack start/stop codons.  For example, SD37\_RS10635 and RS41900 in GCF\_000943515.2 (NZ\_CP016174) don't seem to have a start or stop codon - they begin/end with tgc/cgc and ccc/gaa respectively.  When I visualise them in snapgene (arrows = predicted CDS), they look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[SD37\_RS10635 and RS41900 in GCF\_000943515.2 \(NZ\_CP016174\)](https://preview.redd.it/anotmsip28aa1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12c60f434c794246a12b0052f6e279c9042f0714)

When I used BLASTX it seemed to corroborate the annotated sequences for these proteins, to the degree that BLAST hits align along the annotated region and not the snapgene-predicted CDS regions that aren't part of the annotated CDS.  However, I'm not sure how convincing this is - it says the annotated region is most similar to other BLAST database entries, but presumably the query could simply be a novel version of a database protein.  

In other cases (where the protein was in a BGC and could be compared to homologs in homologous BGCs with the same synteny) it looks like the annotation is wrong and one protein has been broken into several bits.  For example, SD37\_RS42595 looks like it should be part of a bigger protein (orange arrow), and when I blast that I get the protein I would expect (a PKS) with complete query coverage.:

Can anyone answer (i) why CDS without start and stop codons are being annotated and (ii) how far they would trust the annotations?  How would you normally deal with this - would you take the annotated sequence as the true protein, or extend/truncate the annotated protein either end until it matches the snapgene CDS for the annotated protein?

bioinformatics,"While long ago I hailed from the realm of biochemistry, I'm sitting more on the data side these days and can't help but be nostalgic for the possible use of generative neural nets on the bio side. Having a little curiosity, I found that this work has already began somewhat.

For instance, this group managed to get a reasonable design schema by incorporating Attention into their GANs:  [https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00310-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00310-5)

To me then, if we can develop ""reasonable"" (i.e. soluble among other properties) protein sequences using GANs, a natural extension would be to train them for selective binding. For instance, imagine adding the loss from pre-trained Discriminator that predicts binding a certain target into the above.

On one hand, that seems like a tall order, but given some of the research I've thumbed through, I believe such a discriminator is already shown as tenable. Here's a few papers:

* [A meta review of the topic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037022004044)
* [An implementation using Attention](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222014419)
* [Another implementation](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i802/5093239)

Being able to serve up amino acid sequences with selective binding properties seems really attractive and a natural ""next step"" for GAN research here. The closest I have seem though is [this work](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.27.478054v1.abstract) which is more of the flavor of redesigning a sequence rather than a de novo approach.

In short, I reconstructed the MAGs after binning the contigs in my assembly with various binning tools. Then, I aligned the cleaned raw reads from my samples with the contigs belonging to the different MAGs, which allows me to know the number of reads belonging to the different genomes in my dataset. 
After that, I normalize the number of reads by the length of the contigs, to get the average coverage per MAG between my samples.

I thus finally have a MAGs-coverage matrix with the samples in column and the MAGs in raw. So the structure is the same as an OTU abundance matrix derived from metabarcoding data, and I want to compare my different samples to potentially show patterns between my biological conditions.

bioinformatics,"Hello, I ran into an issue processing bulk RNA-seq data from a [study](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30489-X) using my own workflow. Briefly, DESeq2 shows gene expression changes opposite of what the study reports. I suspect some issue in my workflow where the control v non-control data was flipped, but I'm having trouble finding where the error is after some preliminary troubleshooting. However, I suspect the issue might be related to how I'm running DESeq2.

**Context**

I recently processed raw bulk RNA-seq data from [GEO-deposited study data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147507), specifically two biopsied lungs of patients who succumbed to COVID-19 and two biopsied lungs of healthy patients. Each of the four biopsies had four technical replicates. The sequencing depths of the healthy patient biopsies were significantly greater than that of the COVID-19 patient biopsies.

**Data Processing**

I used sratoolkit to download the sra files and dump the fastq files on my drive. I concatenated them, trimmed them with trim-galore and aligned them using hisat2. Subsequently, I did the usual conversion to bam, ran samtools fixmate and sorted them before removing duplicates with samtools markdup. Finally, I ran featureCounts on them before collating them into a four-columned dataframe and running them on DESeq2.

To illustrate my confusion, I show the un-normalized counts of two genes of the four-columned dataframe:

geneid	treatment1	treatment2	control1	control2

ENSG00000108691.10	154	412	1288	695

ENSG00000108700.5	59	182	297	97

ENSG00000116016.14	9	51	3001	2729

treatment1 and treatment2 are the counts of COVID-19 patient lungs while control1 and control2 are the counts of healthy patient lungs. ENSG00000108691.10 (CCL2) was greatly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 patients and ENSG00000108700.5 (CCL8) had an even more positive log2foldchange as compared with CCL2 according to the study. ENSG00000116016.14 is a random gene I picked (EPAS1). If I take the countData, averaged out the counts of treatment v control for CCL2, CCL8 and EPAS1 (just for the sake of example) before getting the ratio, it turns out the ratio of treatment:control is highest for CCL8 (0.59:1), followed by CCL2 (0.28:1) and finally EPAS1 (0.01:1).

Based on these and the lower sequencing depth of treatment1 and treatment2, I was expecting DESeq2 to show CCL8 (ENSG00000108700.5) as most upregulated, followed by CCL2 (ENSG00000108691.10), and finally EPAS1 as downregulated or least upregulated. What I got after DESeq2 processing instead was CCL2's log2foldchange = -4.4, CCL8's log2foldchange = -5.6 and EPAS1's log2foldchange = 0.82. Below is the code I ran in R:

    dds &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=bigTable, colData=metaData, design=~+dex, tidy = TRUE)
    dds$dex &lt;- relevel(dds$dex, ref = ""control"")
    dds &lt;- DESeq(dds)
    res &lt;- results(dds)

The metadata.csv file I used was:

    id,dex,celltype
    treatment1,treatment,lung
    treatment2,treatment,lung
    control1,control,lung
    control2,control,lung

Based on the DESeq2 results, it seems I somehow flipped the control and treatment datasets during the DESeq2 processing. Based on [this](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#note-on-factor-levels) vignette, it seems I correctly assigned control as the [reference level](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/329027_593046fb6d7a427da6b2c538caf601e1.html). Hence, I'm not certain where I went wrong.

bioinformatics,"I'll preface this question the same way I did my last question in this sub: I'm really sorry that I don't know the vocabulary. I'm a first-year CS PhD student with no previous exposure to bioinformatics, so I apologize if these are painfully basic questions.

First question, what is this annotation for ""typing"" the structure of a molecule called? It's parentheses and dots and maybe sometimes brackets? As an example, go to Frabase: [http://rnafrabase.cs.put.poznan.pl/index.php?act=create\_query](http://rnafrabase.cs.put.poznan.pl/index.php?act=create_query) and just click ""Search"". The annotation can be found in the ""Secondary Structure"" column of the resulting page.

Second question, how does one deduce that annotation? For example, I know from Frabase that the dot annotation for 1EHZ should be something like  `(((((((..((((.....[..)))).((((.........)))).....(((((..]....))))))))))))....` . Is there a way I can deduce that string from the JSON returned from the assembly endpoint in the PDB Data API here:  [https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/assembly/1EHZ/1](https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/assembly/1EHZ/1) or any other endpoint from the PDB Data API?

Basically, my goal is to take the PDB ID `1EHZ`, send it to the protein databank data API, and print out the dot annotation from the JSON returned by the API. I assume there's some algorithm that can take the assembly information and return that dot annotation, or maybe even another service that does the same. I guess a simpler way to ask this is ""how does Frabase figure out the data in the `secondary structure` column?""",What is this annotation called: ((..)) and can I deduce it from a PDB assembly?,1672641845
bioinformatics,[removed],Need some advice as an undergraduate student,1672610091
bioinformatics,"So, I did look at the FAQ and couldn't quite find an answer to this.   


Background:

I got my BA in biology back in 2019 and just graduated with my Master's in bio this past May (2022). I originally had the idea to teach in the community college setting and was working as a lab manager at a local community college until a year ago when I realized teaching was NOT for me.   
Now I work as a Customer Support at a small education simulation company. 

I realized this past year how much I enjoy working in data analytics, and bioinformatics or computational biology seem like a good use of my formal education as well as what I actually like to do.

Question:

What do I do to be a marketable candidate for data analytics or bioinformatics type roles? 

Since I have both a BA and MS in bio, I feel like I have the educational background in the biology side of this, but I have no formal education in any sort of coding languages except a little bit in R during my undergrad. 

My search has taken me to places like Coursera where I see a lot of certificates that I could potentially work on to show a more formal education in the informatics side of this career. 

If you saw my resume with the BA and MS in just biology and only a a coursera certificate or two, would I really be marketable? 

I want to make sure I'm pursuing a course of action that is most efficient (i.e. if the ""IBM Data Science Professional Certificate"" on coursera doesn't do squat to help me find a job in the field, I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere).

bioinformatics,"Hi all, I have been doing some microbiome work, and the most tedious part of my analysis is consolidating all individual samples from a single treatment together. I‚Äôm having trouble finding the words to google what sort of package I need to find. For example, if I have results from 20 treatment samples from 20 different sampling dates, I run my analysis pipeline on each individual sample and then it‚Äôs annoying to consolidate all samples belonging to one treatment in excel because not all sample dates have the same bacteria community. There are overlapping species but also some unique species in each sample. Essentially I need one dataset for all treatment samples with the bacteria listed and the relative abundance of that bacteria.

So essentially I need to:
1. Combine multiple samples from one treatment that have overlapping but also unique bacterial species within them, into one dataset
2. Add in 0s for all missing values where a bacteria did not appear for that sample date 

The second is easy but I am struggling to find something for the first option.

Hopefully that made sense. If it helps, the column names I get from each individual sample analysis have columns bacteria, and abundance. For the final consolidated dataset columns would be date, treatment, bacteria, abundance.

For the typical Seurat workflow there are steps to first lognormalize cell counts (dividing count of each gene by total count in cell) and then center (subtract avg count from each feature across cells) and scale (divide each count by stdev of the count of that feature across cells). Cumulatively scaling and centering seems to transform the counts to zscores. 

I'm trying to understand what the purpose and rationale for these steps are so I'm not doing them blindly. 

For the lognormalization, I suppose it makes sense to normalize counts to more adequately compare abundance across cells. But I'm curious why we need to convert counts to zscores. Is there some practical reason, for example by helping downstream clustering?

‚≠ê Highlights ‚≠ê

‚≠ê 1. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to become the primary learning paradigm for distributed cancer research, but specific hurdles have slowed its adoption in the clinical setting.

‚≠ê 2. Labeled medical data is still extremely scarce; this problem also affects federated learning. A plethora of cancer datasets exist (e.g. TCIA, TCGA, Gene Expression Omnibus, etc.), but few of them are labeled for supervised learning. The ones that are labeled (i.e., the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset - for classification, the BraTS dataset - for image segmentation, the Kaggle datasets for skin cancer) are the ones most commonly seen being used in FL.

‚≠ê 3. The largest majority of papers we found use cancer datasets for benchmarking purposes: very few federated learning works solve an actual clinically relevant question. Many of the papers we reviewed propose new software frameworks, and virtually none follow-up with a clinical trial. This leaves FL absent from the field of clinical oncology, based on our literature review.

‚≠ê 4. The compliance and security aspect of healthcare still poses the largest hurdle. Commercial entities such as EHR vendors (e.g., Epic Systems, Cerner, Meditech, Allscripts, etc.), PACS vendors (e.g., GE, Philips, Hitachi, Siemens, Canon, etc.), and other hardware manufacturers (e.g., Nvidia, Intel, etc.) seem to be the best positioned to start pulling together resources, data, and models that use FL to improve patient outcomes.

bioinformatics,"As the title suggests, I am struggling to get Geneious to function on my Macbook Pro after updating it to Monterey version 12.6 in order to solve a previous computer functionality problem. 

Before the update, I used Geneious Version 8.1.9 (on Mac OS Big Sur) and it worked perfectly. Because of the nature of my lab's Geneious license, I cannot use a newer version of Geneious than 8.1.9. 

I have attempted to remove and reinstall the program (I also trashed the installers; however, I did not trash my previous .geneious files, or my Geneious/Geneious Prime backups). For the sake of testing, I also attempted to reinstall the newest version of Geneious, R11.1 (even though it won't work with my lab's license). Both versions successfully installed in my Applications folder, but returned malware warnings upon first opening (see screenshot below).

[Malware warning popup box](https://preview.redd.it/pbcfjhg72z5a1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ec3ec9a2f4b94ee48a738745c95ebe3791516046)

I evaded the malware warning through Get Info &gt; Override Malware Protection. Subsequent attempts to open simply crashed immediately with a popup box saying that Geneious ""quit unexpectedly"" (see screenshots below). Again - this happened with *both* Geneious version 8.1.9 and 11.1.

The crash.log file in my Geneious 8.1 Data folder dates from 3 months ago instead of from today when the problem arose. (The JavaAppLauncher crash reports date from today, but I can't make heads or tails of them.)

[Crash warning popup box for 8.1.9](https://preview.redd.it/gzawm35m2z5a1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=004e8f7aa3a94c5bb7e4bca2c07fb27e937eae59)

Interestingly, I was able to install and use Geneious Prime 2023 without issue from the [same website](https://www.geneious.com/download/previous-versions/). This did *not* crash, nor did it generate any malware warnings like its full-version cousin, and I don't know why the difference there.

The only solution I can find online is to revert my laptop back to its previous OS via completely wiping the hard drive, which would (as I understand it) require me to, before the wipe, manually isolate and save on a *different* external hard drive every file I need to preserve. I do not find this an efficient solution, I can't be sure it would work, and I do not want the problem I originally updated to Monterey to solve to return. I also don't want to have to purchase a second laptop solely to run an old OS and Geneious on.

I have submitted a support request to [Geneious](https://help.geneious.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) already and am waiting to hear back from them.

Has anyone else encountered this problem with Geneious before and/or could potentially assist me with, or direct me to other avenues for, troubleshooting this issue?

bioinformatics,"So I was given a sample sequenced through Pacbio‚Äôs new Mas-iso seq platform. PacBio has returned the result and I needed the files necessary for a Seurat compatible input ( so the matrix, barcodes, and features). I also needed the bam file to visualize the bam file in IGV. Both were present in the final output but I‚Äôm noticing a strange result that I can‚Äôt explain.   
Essentially, IGV is displaying reads and their corresponding UMI that are not present in the Seurat object, even though the cell barcodes are present in both. And I'm not sure why.   


[Screenshot of IGV visualization and information on a random read aligned to CALR. I have highlighted the Cell Barcode ](https://preview.redd.it/xxb4ud6sby5a1.png?width=2772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a92b3d7a88ef37acd05d20c62eca5c921b99d1a6)

So the screenshot shows many reads aligning to CALR and with good coverage. But when I check the seurat object, there is only one cell that detects 1 UMI.   
I generated plots from a downstream analysis of the Seurat object that shows the same discrepancy but here I will show the raw dataset to simplify it and show that filtering is not occurring.   


    #Loading in seurat compatible files in genes_seurat folder (matrix, genes, barcodes) 
    
    
    pb_dataset &lt;-  Read10X(""path/to/genes_seurat"", gene.column = 2, cell.column = 1, unique.features = TRUE, strip.suffix = FALSE)
    
    #Indexing the count matrix based off gene name to get a list of cells and their UMI counts associated with CALR
    
    
    calr_umi_counts_pb &lt;- as.data.frame(pb_dataset['CALR',])
    calr_umi_counts_pb &lt;- cbind(calr_umi_counts_pb, rownames(calr_umi_counts_pb))
    

This code outputs a dataframe of UMI counts across Cell barcodes for one gene. I've added another column based off the rownames to be able to search for barcodes.   


[Resulting table based on descending order of UMI counts. ](https://preview.redd.it/0xza0zj2dy5a1.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b5c0e7c0bdb62bc29cac4652ff5503d6271793c4)

This shows only one cell detects one UMI for CALR which is very different than what IGV is showing. And this dataset was generated just by loading in the files necessary to create a Seurat object. So no downstream filtering has occurred.  
Next I looked to see if maybe the cells being visualized in IGV weren‚Äôt in the Seurat Object so I randomly selected one read which is why I highlighted the cell barcode in my first screenshot which was CATTCTATGCCTACGG. 

The same sample had been sequenced through 10x because the original question was an interest in comparing transcript coverage. So they share the same cell barcodes but the PB data has to have its barcodes reverse complemented (I believe because of how it's being sequenced in the ZMW but I could be wrong). So reverse transcribing the Cell Barcode I highlighted, you get CCGTAGGCATAGAATG. 

When I search the PB datagrame for that cell barcode, it is present but no UMIs are detected. Even though that same cell had displayed a read in IGV. 

[Looking at a specific cell barcode with 0 UMI count even though the IGV displayed a read ](https://preview.redd.it/ser52rvmdy5a1.png?width=2222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5743fcc6d085088c5b02671e55a74b9f413990e3)

Is there something about IGV I am grossly misunderstanding? I don't think there is anything wrong with my R script but maybe thats also an issue? I recreated the bam file following PacBio‚Äôs pipeline and got the same bam file as their platform has given so I‚Äôm very lost here. I would appreciate any strategy or direction

bioinformatics,"I'm a first-year PhD student, with a B.S. in microbiology. I have intermediate level experience with java/javascript/python but only for personal projects; I don't have any formal training in computer science. I'm finishing up my second of two rotations and I need to pick a lab soon; both of my rotation advisors have told me they would take me if I wanted to join their lab. But I'm having trouble choosing, and I think a lot of it comes down to not fully understanding the state of the field and what type of skills would be more/less useful to pick up during my PhD. 

Both labs are fairly similar on their face; they both develop tools for analyzing microbial DNA sequences. Both are 100% dry lab. I get along extremely well with both of the advisors and I enjoyed both of my rotations immensely. I'll term them lab A and lab B.

Lab A develops tools for transposon analysis. It's the new/hip/modern ""where the field is going"" lab, as the advisors of both lab A and lab B have told me. It's ""pipeline-oriented"", makes use of environment management tools like conda, and its publications focus on both the tools themselves and the actual conclusions that can be drawn from them, so they publish in both bioinformatics and genetics journals. Although the lab itself is a 100% dry lab, they do have collaborations and co-publications with wet labs. I would be working primarily on data analysis using an existing program the lab has developed; the PI wants to bring on another student to keep developing it, but has essentially said that he wants someone with a computer science background, so it wouldn't be me.

Lab B is the lab of a very senior professor, who isn't taking on students anymore but has agreed to make an exception for me (he taught one of my intro classes and we've talked a lot outside of class as I'm a trans dude and he has a trans son that's my age). In this lab, I would have my own project, started from scratch, writing a program to process some kind of DNA data and get some kind of output (either my rotation project, or if that doesn't go anywhere, a new project we would come up with). The PI is very oriented toward low-level programming languages and algorithm development, which I don't have much past experience with but I think would be very interesting. He's intonated that this part of the field is more competitive, though.

Importantly, Lab B doesn't have any funding. However, he's arranged for the department to fund me for spring (the department has a lot more money than students interested in the program, as admission is through a general-biology admission program, and some years, like this one, only a couple students join the binf department). After that I would be TAing the graduate-level BINF classes I've taken for the remainder of my PhD (my school doesn't have an undergraduate BINF program). Lab A doesn't have guaranteed funding, so I may or may not have to TA, but the PI is still actively applying for grants, so it's likely that I wouldn't have to TA every semester and may not have to TA at all.

I could see myself enjoying both labs for sure, and I'm not sure which one would be better to join. My partner works in computer science and has suggested that ""efficient programming"" --ie the algorithm development/low level efficient stuff -- may not actually be very important in career prospects (""if your program takes more storage space than it needs to, the company will just buy more hard drives""), but that it's a harder skill to pick up so if I want to learn it, doing it now is a good idea. I am quite interested in it but I'm concerned that competitiveness/oversaturation in that field may be an obstacle both to publication and to eventually getting a job in that area. I guess my questions are:

1) Is one group of skills more useful than another or more important to get ""early on"" in my career?

2) How are the prospects in each sub-field? Is algorithm development too saturated?

3) If I'm not sure which area I will end up in long term, would training in one area now give me more or less narrow future options?

bioinformatics,"I'm interested in implementing a metatranscriptomics pipeline. I see a variety of options, but I'm struggling to determine an approach that is best suited to my needs. 

My highest priorities at present are using a de novo, RNA-seq specific (splice-aware) assembler. I will need to parse the assembly using alignment methods to identify reads of interest.

Per the paper linked below, I have found 3 possibilities - SqueezeMeta, MOSCA, and IMP (I'm not interested in using HUMAnN for several reasons).

[**https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00904/full**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00904/full)

SqueezeMeta and MOSCA both use metagenomic de novo assemblers, which is my main reservation in attempting to use them. Using metagenomic assemblers for RNA-seq data is not a validated approach, to my knowledge. IMP requires a corresponding metagenome, which I do not have for these samples.

The paper also demonstrates that Trinity has been shown to be at least somewhat effective for de novo metatranscriptome assembly, despite being designed for single-organism assembly. Several Biostars posts also suggest that Trinity is a good option for this.

So, here's what I'm thinking I'll try.

1. Filter human reads using STAR
2. Trim and assemble the remaining reads using Trinity
3. Use the assembly to generate a gff and amino acid fasta using Prodigal
4. Use other tools to identify reads of interest using the protein fasta (BLAST, etc)
5. Align reads using the gff and STAR (or maybe hisat2)
6. Quantify reads of interest using Salmon (or stringtie)

bioinformatics,"Hello everyone! I have a great interest in the field of bioinformatics but really need some advice. Here is my situation:

I am an international student in Ontario, Canada and in my last semester of Biochemistry, graduating this month. I have had three co-op work terms but none of those were really related to Bioinformatics. I also have completed a minor in Mathematical Science which comprised of calculus, stats, and computer science courses.

I will be taking a three month break after graduating and plan to learn Python and polish my skills in R during that time.

I will get my 3 year post graduate work permit after graduating and plan to start work somewhere in April. Any advice on where I should apply and if I would be able to get a job relating to bioinformatics with my current education and skills? I do know the basics of C and R and will be learning Python. Also I plan to master in Bioinformatics but after I get my PR which would take roughly 2 to 2.5 years from now.

bioinformatics,"The key idea is to take advantage of the stochastic nature of diffusion to generate a probability distribution that is used to determine the location of the mutation. In particular, the model is designed to have a very high probability of occurring in a region of interest (ROI), but a low probability of occuring in other regions that are not of interest. This is in contrast to the more commonly used Monte Carlo method, which attempts to assign a probability to every point in the model space.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a number of issues to be dealt with when trying to implement this in software. First, one has to be careful not to overfit the model to the data. This can be done by using a Bayesian estimator of the likelihood of the model, as is done in the paper cited above. Another issue is that, as mentioned above, the model has to be able to deal with non-Gaussian distributions. A solution to this is to use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the generation of the distribution. This is an iterative algorithm that allows one to iteratively improve the model as one goes through the process of mutation and diffusion. However, it is computationally expensive, and requires a lot of memory to store the state of the model at each iteration.

&amp;#x200B;

In my work, I‚Äôve been looking at ways to speed up the MCMC algorithm. One of the things that I‚Äôve come up with is to use a technique known as backpropagation. This is a well-studied technique for learning to solve problems that are hard to solve by hand. For example, it is used in machine learning to find patterns in data that are hidden from the user. The idea is that the data is divided into blocks, and each block is trained on a subset of the data. After training, the blocks are recombined to form a model that generalizes to the rest of the data. This technique is very powerful, and can be used to train models that are much more complex than those that can be trained by hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Backpropagation works by applying a gradient descent algorithm to the model. Gradient descent is a fairly simple algorithm, but one that is difficult to get right. It is easy to fall into what is known as the Levenshtein-Fokker-Planck (LFP) trap, where the gradient descends too quickly, and ends up converging to a value that is too close to the value that you want to converge to. To avoid this, one has to make sure that the gradient is slow enough to give time for the algorithm to converge to the right value. This is a problem that has been tackled by a number of researchers, most notably John Resig \[4\]. He has found a way to do this by adding a delay to the gradient descent algorithm. This delay is based on the length of the block of data that is being trained. If the block is small, there is little need for a delay, and the algorithm can be run quickly. On the other hand, if the block is large, it is better to wait a little longer before running the algorithm, so that the algorithm has more time to converge to the right value.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that this might be a good idea for a model that is going to be used to solve problems that are hard to solve by hand. So I wrote a program that implements the algorithm, and tested it on a number of problems. Here are the results:

&amp;#x200B;

The performance is good, and I was able to get it to converge to the right value in less than 10,000 iterations. This is a lot faster than the time it would take to run the algorithm by hand, and it is comparable to the performance of the LFP algorithm that Resig used in his paper.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the problems that I ran into was that the algorithm didn‚Äôt seem to work very well on images that had noise in them. This is because the noise is spread across the image, and it is difficult to tell where the noise is coming from. I ended up having to do some work to make things work, but it was worth it to get the algorithm to work as well as it did.",Thoughts on using Diffusors For Bio?,1670469219
bioinformatics,"I'm about 16 months into my postdoc, and am coming to the swift and startling realization that the tenure track is not for me. The thought of scraping by on mid five-figure salaries for the next 3-5 (or more) years with minimal benefits and poor work/life balance only to \*maybe\* get a PI position that would bring with it the additional stress of securing grants just to get by makes me want to vomit. Plus, I am becoming increasingly more angry at being a cog in the academic machine that values postdocs not as doctorate-level thinkers but as a nearly free source of undervalued labor.

So now I'm looking around at my 55k/year postdoc salary while still feeling like I'm being treated much like a grad student and wondering what I am still doing here.

I have a strong wet-lab background, but am truly  passionate about computational science. I am in no means a computer programer, but I have a very solid understanding of molecular biology, which gives me a leg-up when it comes to data analysis and understanding experimental methods/design. I have experience with Python, R, and Linux shell scripting, and have done a tone of transcriptomics analysis and 16S amplicon community analysis for microbiome projects. I don't have any ML experience, but that's something I'd be very excited about getting into.

Since I am straying away from the PI track and my current lab isn't providing me much advanced training/mentorship, I've gotten in the rut of feeling like I'm just an underpaid lab tech, which is NOT why I got my PhD. I shouldn't feel this way....I don't work much more than 40 hours a week and am decently productive publication wise, but I just feel so blah going into work every day. It would be so nice to be excited about my role again and feel valued for my skills and contributions (both monetarily and within the lab!). 

The must-haves on my future job list are: 

* Remote/hybrid work (I do not want to relocate but would travel every other month or so for meetings and such)
* Make a decent amount of money for my education level (100k+ would be ideal)
* Have a trusting supervisor who values my work and trusts me to get it done on my own schedule (obviously would be available during certain times for meetings and such)
* Decent vacation/benefits and generally good work/life balance (right now I get 10 total vacation days....so anything over that would be great).

So far, I've considered going into industry (I've been casually submitting industry job applications, but the biotech market is a tough place right now with a lot of layoffs), finding a staff scientist position at my current University, or a jumping ship from bioinformatics and being a science writer. I have 3 publications I'm wrapping up in the next couple of months that I really want to complete before I would leave, but I am fairly miserable on a daily basis with my current position.

I'm wondering if anyone have any similar experiences, and/or any advice for me at this stage? I think I just also needed to vent a bit....being a postdoc is much more mentally taxing that I expected, and I feel like I'm constantly being gaslighted  by academia into thinking I should be grateful for my stipend and the handouts (like healthcare) that I do receive.

I want a bioinformatics/computational biology internship in industry after my 4th year and similarly a job upon graduation (after 5th or 6th year). I have concerns that I won‚Äôt have extensive experience by the time I graduate. This is because I won‚Äôt get data I need for my main projects till the start of year 4 (infectious disease single cell omics projects). I‚Äôm not from a hardcore coding lab that mostly uses omic databases like gtex and gwas summary stats etc. I‚Äôve had to do time consuming extensive fieldwork to generate my data. I have peers from dry labs who spend all 5-6 PhD years immersed in intensive coding projects. I‚Äôm worried that compared to them I won‚Äôt be as competitive when applying for jobs since I‚Äôll just have 1-2 years experience. 

Background:
My first PhD project was on infectious disease epidemiology (long story)and I‚Äôve become relatively good at R. I have experience with Unix,Python, HPCC from classes but I‚Äôve never carried out an actual project with them. As a third year I‚Äôm starting to get self conscious of my lack of experience with analyzing/simulating -omic data. When I‚Äôm at meetings or conferences with other population geneticists I can understand the theory of their research but I get lost in the bionformatic jargon they talk about. I spent my first 2 years on my epidemiology project (completed) and studying for my qualifying exams. I am in my 3rd year and it involves a lot of fieldwork, data collection, reading and grant writing. I‚Äôm trying to figure out a computational genetics side project I can do but tbh I‚Äôm so tired after fieldwork that I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth. In my 4-5th years I‚Äôll finally have data I need for my -omic projects. 

I know that I‚Äôm complaining and sound insecure but It‚Äôll be nice to get some reassurance from people that might have been in this position or work with/hired people in my position. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt feel supported by my PI and he isn‚Äôt the kind of person I can talk to about things like this",Biology PhD Student: Advice Needed,1670449877

bioinformatics,"I think I'm in a bit of a funk right now and I keep feeling so weird about what I'm doing and where my career is going. So this is just kind of a rant and I'm looking for some reassurance maybe.

I work in a bioinformatics lab and will be starting my master's soon. When I first started working in the lab as an intern I didn't know anything so I asked a lot of questions (I have no prior experience in bioinformatics). But many of my colleagues that have been here for a long time didn't know the answers to my questions. As a result, I really had to study everything on my own. 

Even with something basic like DEG analysis (just using tools like DESeq or EdgeR) I always have something I am unsure about and no one can help me. For instance, my data had very different results depending on what type of normalisation I used in EdgeR. I asked my lab members at a progress meeting and no one knew why that would happen.

I feel like everyone just uses tools without knowing what they really do and when something goes a bit wrong, they just go with the methods that give the best results. Is this normal? Isn't knowing why we use a particular methodology supposed to be important? If I just tried a bunch of methods and went with the result that ""looks good"" is that okay?

The PI is way too busy to deal with the details (my lab has many departments and tons of projects in multiple research areas) so my colleagues and I are the ones that have to be responsible for the most part. The PI told me that when I use a tool or algorithm, I should know it well enough to be able to recreate it and run it myself, but my colleagues definitely don't do that. 

To what extent am I expected to know everything when the people around me don't seem to know? I feel like my PI is quite right, but nobody else seems to study deeply enough to do that. Don't get me wrong, my colleagues are all smart and probably way better researchers than I am. We also don't have much time because of the overflowing projects. 

It just seems so meaningless to struggle with some basic knowledge all day and then ultimately use arbitrary parameters for results that ""look good"" because I don't know the answer to my questions.

I was given the data as bam files and also have the sequencing sample statistics from when the samples were run including the number of total reads, aligned reads, and unaligned reads. I converted the bam files back to fastq files using

samtools view -h -F 2048 filename.bam &gt; tmp.bam

After converting the bam files back to fastq files, I ran the MAGeCK count function. I saw that none of the total reads matched between the MAGeCK count summary output file and the original sequencing statistics. 

More problematically, a few samples had significantly fewer total reads (like 50,000) shown on the MAGeCK count summary output files relative to the original sequencing statistics (\~44 million). As a result, many of the sgRNAs are not represented at all in the sample (there are \~61,000 zero counts relative to the total 77441 sgRNAs) which is impacting my analysis.

bioinformatics,"So I switched into bioinformatics earlier at the start of this year. Over the past three semesters (summer included) I feel like I‚Äôve barely learned anything related to bioinformatics.

My bioinformatics professor is an ecologist so all our in classwork has revolved around population data, not molecular or genetic based like I do in my lab, or want to do with my career. Basically I feel like I‚Äôm learning nothing and will be graduating this spring. I want to know if any of you with experience know of any published data sets/gene panel I can practice building pipelines on? I just feel like I can‚Äôt count on anyone but myself right now to get experience but I just don‚Äôt know where to start. My lab has given me a foundation but I feel no where near ready or prepared to go into industry and be confident in a job. Is it possible to practice these skills on my own or is it better to just hold my breath and wait for on-site job training and learn that way?

bioinformatics,"I'm currently a university student at a state school who's expected to graduate by the end of this December with a BS in Computational Biology (no other relevant majors or minors). 

Not gonna lie... I really think I pooched it, guys. I feel like I have a decent amount of experience in bioinformatic tools and processes (RNAseq, CHIPseq, Autodock, BEDtools, in-silico lead optimization, etc.), some introductory knowledge of data science (and some basic knowledge ML algorithms from training seminars), and I'm basically fine with basic-to-intermediate Python and R coding. 

Unfortunately, that's basically where it ends. My GPA is pretty low (~2.86) and my transcript grades are basically up and down all the way from freshman year to senior year (the COVID pandemic started during the second half of sophomore year, and some unrelated long term health problems during my stay too, but I don't really want make excuses). FWIW I've done pretty consistently okay in basically... *only* my bioinformatic classes (B- to A- range).

As far as resume goes, I really only have my degree to my name, which I'm really disappointed in myself for. I studied under a lot of great instructors who are incredibly knowledgeable and have done amazing research in the field, but my grades in their classes weren't amazing and I never felt like I was able to get really close to any of them. Actually, I feel like I haven't really much networking at all, and I don't have anything really in terms of research/academic/work/extracurricular experience (unless you count a few R and Python workflows from class projects up on Github, but it's honestly just some basic stuff).

Obviously with all that a MS is basically out of the picture (not that I would have been able to afford it right out of school without scholarships anyways, and I think most MS programs prefer a minimum of 3.0 GPA for applicants anyways, right...?), so I was planning on doing entry-level lab and industry work stuff for around 1-3 years to build up some relevant work experience while maybe doing some non-matriculated courses on the side and then coming back to it later. Unfortunately, it seems like almost every job listing seems to want at least a MS to even be considered. I've sent out a good handful of applications to some lab technician and data analyst positions for fresh undergrads (0-2 years experience) but they've all been ignored. 

~~Am I underqualified because of my lack of skills or because the only job openings I can find online are all for lab tech positions at really high-ranking schools? Am I unlucky because of the shaky economy? Am I doomed forever...?!? (Sorry, dramatics. I've been feeling pretty crazy recently as it gets closer and closer to the end of the semester)~~

With most of the personal context out of the way: **realistically, what sort of jobs should I be looking for fresh out of undergrad with little to offer?**

And if you guys don't mind some other questions...
* Is relocating recommended or is it better to look for open positions near me? I'm in the Mid-atlantic region, but a lot of the jobs I'm seeing are all in Boston or CA since they're the biotech hubs right now. 
* Not as important since I'm basically just looking for any job at this point, but do you know what the approx salary range I should expect for someone of my qualifications (or lack thereof)? I was applying to various positions assuming it would something towards like 30k-50k USD max, but now I'm worried that might even be too high of an estimate.
* How do I know if my technical skills are enough to fulfill the needs of the position? Honestly, I'm not even sure what positions I should be applying to when almost all are either ""Masters required"" or ""Bachelor's required, Masters preferred"". 
* Has anyone else been in a similar situation as me? If so, could I ask to hear some success stories? It would really help reassure me a bit   :')

Sorry for the long post everyone, I'm just... really stressed about everything ending so soon while I still feel so unprepared.

bioinformatics,"So i know questions about how to write a CV have been asked before here quite a few times but i guess i got some 'additions' / modifications to these general questions.  


Basically, i've just finished my MSc in Bioinformatics &amp; computational biology and i'm now searching for a job. Now i've got veeeeeery little other than my degree to show for and i'm wondering how to make the most of what i got to work with &amp; how to best present some 'not so great' gaps in my CV in a positive manner.  


1. The only work experience i've got is a 6 month temporary contract at the same uni-associated-lab i did my master's thesis in (and on the same project). However, the coding work i did for that job is... not in a form i would present to a potential employer. I'm not necessarily worried about its functionality (at least not more than the usual paranoia about uncaught bugs) but since my supervisor/boss did not seem to prioritize code cleanliness, readability &amp; reusability time was not really allocated for that. So i feel like i don't have anything to show from this time.
2. Before i started the BSc (biochem) &amp; MSc i ended up graduating in i also FAILED a BSc program at a more competitive (= 'harder') uni in electrical engineering and information technology. Since i'd say this is kind of a related field, i feel like that probably doesn't look all that great on a CV.  
Any chance this can be spun in a positive way (e.g. showing that i'm really interested in the intersection of biology &amp; IT or that the technical skills i gained from it, though not 'sufficient' for a degree, complement my biochem background). Alternatively, should i either a) mention this failed study program as discretely as possible in the CV or b) leave it out of the CV completely and only mention it when asked (i didn't drop out early but spent three years on it so i feel like its a gap that would be hard to gloss over) 

So basically, the only plus points i got going for me are 6 months of 'work experience' (but not 'in the industry' per se) and really rather good grades (though AFAIK that counts for next to nothing).

bioinformatics,"Hi everyone,

Background:

As part of a review on the potential of cellular enlargement as a new ageing factor our group manually went through thousands of abstracts and then hundreds of papers to find papers that reported a correlation between cell size and some aspect of ageing (an actual causal relationship has only been shown in blood stem cells last year).

So now I have a dataset of around 1300 papers that were hits, and another few thousand that appeared in our search on pubmed but did not report a correlation.

What I would like to do is to use the dataset to train an AI to do the same thing we did 1. For new studies 2. For other aspects of ageing that we did not look out.

The problem:
Some search terms returned a lot more hits than others (makes sense since how much size matters likely varies between biological systems). However, because of this I'm not sure how useful the dataset is actually in recognising ""things connected with ageing"" (picking up in ""cell size"" is easy since it is mentioned in all the papers)

I have limited experience with machine learning and none outside of some hobbyist fascination with natural language processing algorithms.

Any suggestions on how to help an algorithm pick up on such a multifaceted thing such as ageing would be appreciated. Also I am unsure whether my dataset is large enough for such a project.

Here is a link to our paper for those interested ([Cellular enlargement - a new hallmark of aging](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.1036602/full)). The dataset was used to construct Figure 3.

Reading here and there, I understood that G=-KblogP(s), where s is a state. I assume that to plot these surfaces in unbiased molecular dynamics, I would compute the P(cv1, cv2) for every value of cv1 and cv2 observed in my simulation, i.e. just counting how many times a specific combination happens (presumably by histogramming to have some ranges), and normalizing, and then simply apply Kblog to each of these probabilities. Assuming that this is correct:

\- how specifically the probabilities are calculated, in terms of how the bins of values are defined for the histogram, and so on?

\- why using 2 collective variables, rather than just plotting the potential of mean force with one of them, or using three of them? in other words, why the 2D convention is so much used in the papers, rather than others?

I hope this is not a super-stupid question, and I will greatly appreciate if you could point to me where to find a tutorial for this - as well as some pedagogical material that I can use to educate myself (ideally, something that explains FES calculations in unbiased and biased biomolecular simulations).

bioinformatics,"Hello,

I'm a aspirant PhD student currently involved in the application processes. As today I got rejected for the 4th time (once I was shortlisted and then rejected, the other 3 times I was directly rejected), some question started to come up in my mind.

1. How am I supposed to learn from failed applications?

Feedbacks received (after weeks/months of waiting) are usually something like ""Your application process ends here"" or ""You have not been shortlisted for the above position, so you are not among the candidates selected for assessment"". Now, I'm not expecting ETH to give me a detailed explanation on why my application failed, but I find it difficult to understand what went wrong.

2) Does being a ""pure"" bioinformatician represent a disadvantage?

Most of the PhD vacancies under the search term ""bioinformatics"" or ""computational biology"" regard both dry &amp; wet lab tasks. As I pursued a purely computational path in my career and have no experience with the wet lab, the positions that really suits my CV are very limited.

3) How much value do recruiters give to publications?

I feel like candidates with a publication are pretty advantaged. Fair enough. However I think, *with due exceptions*, publishing during the bachelor's or master's years is more a matter of being in the right place at the right time rather than being a better PhD candidate.  Although my CV has some strengths (highest graduation score, some individual projects in the portfolio and period spent on a quite known institute as an intern), I do not currently have a publication.  Should I spend some time in a lab to get one and then go back to PhD applications?

4) Does the Motivational letter really matter? Do you have any tips on how to write a good one?

I thought this was the most important step. I try to apply some guidelines based on what I find on YouTube or blogs. For example I write a specific letter to the institute I am applying for, rather than having a standard motivational letter used multiple times. However, I am afraid that given these multiple rejections, my letters are missing something.

I think I need to change something with my applications, otherwise I'll keep getting rejected.

bioinformatics,"Hello guys, hope you all are doing well. We have the opportunity to upgrade our server infrastructure.  Will be used predominantly for NGS (Exome + genome) data (No ML yet, but would like to keep options open).

There is no fixed budget to work with - generally the lower the better. For the sake of post, lets consider 10 lakh INR (\~12k USD) as the maximum budget.

Usage - There are 3 bioinformaticians who use the servers, mainly for processing research WES/WGS data, but also running analysis using different tools (For ex. to detect CNVs, kinship analysis, etc). We have hosted a HTTP server and a streamlit app where our lab mates (\~15 individuals) can access files and data. The server is running on RHEL7, main tools we use include bwa-mem2, gatk suite, annovar, etc.

We are currently using a server with the following specification -

&gt;Dell 2u server (Bought in 2016)  
&gt;  
&gt;Intel Xeon E5-2660 v4 x 2, 12 cores, 24 threads, totalling to 56 threads  
&gt;  
&gt;RAM - 378 GB  
&gt;  
&gt;Storage - 72TB mounted in 2 equal sized partitions, RAID 5 (6TB HDD x 13)  
&gt;  
&gt;Gigabit networking

We have roughly 5 TB storage remaining. We have \~3000 exome samples , \~40 WGS samples (all the samples have BAMs + fastq.gz files) and a bunch of softwares and resources. We try to remove intermediate files as soon as possible, but the server tends to be in use most of the time. We use OneDrive to backup the gvcf files (University email comes with 1 TB OneDrive storage, but this is just a spot fix) but BAM files aren't backed up any where. We plan to delete older data, ex. any data 3 or more years old. However, even such files are accessed occasionally when doing analysis. 

As of now, there is essentially one working copy of the data. Due to budget constraints, we would make a copy of raw data (fastq files) to 4 TB hard drives, catalogue the drives with VVV (good software) and retrieve the necessary hard drive in case we need any fastq files. I've been told I can delete the backed up fastq files from server, but I would rather not do that. We live in coastal regions and there is no telling how the external hard drives might (or might not) react to that.

&amp;#x200B;

My ideas are as follows - 

1. Use a NAS to store archived BAM and fastq files
2. If possible, upgrade server

There is a NAS model from Dell which might be suitable for our purpose, but quoted for 4 lakhs INR with decked out storage (12TB x 4).

So instead of just upgrading our storage, I'm thinking of retiring old server for storage + some experimental stuff and buying a new server instead.

&amp;#x200B;

The configuration I've decided is as follows -

* PowerEdge 750xs 
* Intel Silver 4314 (16C, 32T) x 2
* 256 GB RAM (which is eye wateringly expensive!)
* 1.2 TB HDD for OS, as just a 480 GB SSD was quited for \~600USD)
* Roughly 12 TB HDD storage

I have as input: 20ish high quality chromosome level assemblies from a single genus with a relatively large genome.

 I don't care about structural rearrangements at all and it doesn't have to be the best possible method out there. Ideally it's reference free so the ancestral sequence reconstruction is not biased, but I'll live if not. 

I've been using cactus but it's driving me nuts. I turned the output hal into a maf, and when I tried to extract the ancestral sequence, it gave me a fasta with 40,000 blocks.

If I choose the genetics major I'll take pharmacogenetics, cell biology, a precision medicine course, and some other genetics classes.

bioinformatics,"Hey bioinformatics community!

I am applying for CS / Computational Biology PhD programs in the US this year (mostly coming from the CS and Machine Learning side), and I have a few doubts/confusion about whether my profile is competitive enough:

Strong points:

1. I have a Master's degree from a prestigious and well-known university.
2. I have published research papers, and more are on the way, although they won't be published before the admission process is over.
3. I have worked under a professor who is well-known in the field, and he knows me well.

Weak points:

1. I don't have a research paper as a first author.
2. I don't have a third LOR from a professor, only from a professional one. I tried to get some positions this year by emailing professors from other universities but did not get a response.
3. I don't have a 4+ GPA (just slightly less).
4. My major is in Computer Science, although I did take many computational biology courses, as well as CS courses like ML and NLP that are going to be relevant in Computational Biology

LOR:

1. From the professor who is well-known in the field
2. From another professor with whom I published a paper - although he is pretty blunt as to who he will give his ""top"" referral letter every year, and I am sure it's not going to be me.
3. From my manager at an internship as I mentioned before.

bioinformatics,"Hello everybody,

it's me again, bothering with another CNAs/cancer question.

I started working with cancer data, in particular with CNAs. Unfortunately, I do not have a strong biological background, and basically none in cancer. So, even after reading all the related answers I could find and more related papers, it is still have many doubts.I will try to list them for the sake of a clear exposition:

1. **How is the CN defined?** I'll try to explain. When detecting CNVs using read depth, what is usually done is mapping back the reads and then try to identify regions with higher/lower coverage then others. So, for e.g., in the case of a normal diploid genome, if I had a copy of a region only in one chromosome, by mapping back all my reads to the reference, I would expect to find that one region has double the normalized coverage of the others, so detecting that there is **1** more copy of that particular region with respect to a reference. In the case of a tetraploid sample, I would expect that if a region is duplicated in a single cromosome, I would still detect an absolute gain of **1** for that region. Is this correct?
2. **What are the relative and absolute copy numbers?** I found these different answers on the web, so I couldn't figure out. Taking into account the previous example, i.e. having a gain of **1** copy of a segment, would this be a *relative* CN? And if I knew the ploidy, how would I use it to find the *absolute* CN?
3. In my case, I would need to **compare the results** from multiple tools. Would it still make sense to eventually compare the *relative* CN, if I do not know the tumor ploidy?

Since the HCC1395 cell line was already studied before, I found some other studies providing the CNAs they found for it. My question now is: can I use those CNAs found in other studies on the same cell line as a ground truth to compare what I will find with our tool on the data I have?

I don't have much biological knowledge and my doubts arise manly because, If I undersood well, those cells are usually grown independently in a laboratory setting for each study, so I am not sure if they are comparable, or if they could have different mutations occurring between the different studies.

Knowing these things would have probably saved me weeks in work time.  


**Separate your data processing, data analysis and visualization scripts:**  
In my view the three major components of much of bioinformatics and data science in general is A. getting and processing your data, B. running your analyses and C. creating plots and graphs of your data and analyses. Since you might want to tweak each one independently (for me getting the plots just right was a Sisyphean nightmare, I work in python) you should be able to do each of those things separately by generating all the files you need as an output from the previous part and use them in the entry point of the next part. This way you don't need to execute your entire pipeline each time just to see if the font size change you just made to figure 7 looks better. This may sound obvious, but not necessarily to someone who never did this before.  


**Don't wait too long to ask for help:**  
You will inevitably get to a point where you need it. It is good to try to solve things yourself for the learning experience, but you also shouldn't let certain problems take too much of your time since there are many other things to do and learn and not too much time, especially in a masters degree. This refers to both asking your PI/colleagues for help but also other people. Don't be afraid to reach out to the authors of a paper (after running it by your PI if you don't already have his full confidence) and ask questions. The corresponding author will most likely refer you to the first author who will usually be happy to talk about the paper.   


**Don't try to generalize your code in advance unless you have too much time on your hands:**  
You may be tempted to make some methods or plotting functions more general than you need for the specific analysis you are currently doing, anticipating that in the future you will want to generalize (plot the analysis of an arbitrary number of datasets instead of just the one you are doing right now, have the option to change some of your model's parameters in the function call, etc.) but in my experience this is kind of a waste of time, on average. Unless your are sure that you will be using it (like if you are actually going to do it immediately after trying the simpler case) then it is safe enough to postpone writing more complicated code. You may be surprised at how often plans change and most of the time you will be trying out new things, rather than enhancing older analyses (that part usually only comes later).  


**Never, ever measure yourself against what others are doing:**  
There will be many other students with strong backgrounds in the things you wish you knew better, doing things that look incredible and make it look easy doing it. There will also be many students who will be struggling more than you. It is important to remember that everyone has different backgrounds, different opportunities, and different natural abilities. We may have different viewpoints on this but in my opinion everything is pretty much up to chance: You don't get to choose what interests you, how fast you learn, what projects you get (at first), how much motivation you will have 1 - 1.5 years into your degree (or even how likely you are as a person to overcome periods of poor mental health and low motivation - even managing to push through these hard times is an ability that some have and some don't). Even if you don't like the results you get or feel bad about your effort and motivation because others seem to be doing better, and even if the degree doesn't work out for you in the end,  you should feel pride in your hard work and the work you are doing to  push through because if you care enough to feel bad about it then you are probably already doing what you can. Take things one day at a time and remember everyone turns out OK in the end.  


Documenting your thoughts and things you tried: I know a lot of people recommend keeping track of what they do with a log or work manager, but I found it to be kind of hit or miss: All of my work was documented by definition anyway as code, and for me simply having a list of things I'm supposed to be doing in the next couple of weeks to cross off as I do them was sufficient - anything more felt like a bit of a time waste with micromanaging myself.

I am running a bunch of neural networks in pytorch/jax in parallel and since this will (hopefully) be eventually published, I want to ensure it is as reproducible as possible.

Here's my question right now, I need to run a set of models completely in parallel, just with different seeds/frozen stochastic realizations. These are trained off of simulations from a model that will also be run completely in parallel within the training loop.

Eventually, down the road, after each training step I will need to sum a computed value in each training step and after running it through a simple function, pass the result back to all agents as part of the data they will learn from. So it is no longer quite embarrassingly parallel, but still highly parallel beyond that aggregation step.

What is the best way to do this efficiently? Should I be looking at snakemake/nextflow and writing/reading from datafiles, passing these objects back and forth?

I have a cohort of patient and controls who have undergone whole genome sequencing. I have then done collapsing rare variant testing using SAIGE-GENE and found a gene that is strongly enriched in the disease cohort. I have then applied a validated polygenic risk score (PRS) and again found a statistically significant enrichment in cases over controls both including and excluding those cases that are part of the monogenic hit. A subset analysis of the PRS cases and controls with variants that qualified  for the monogenic hit show a near doubling of the PRS in cases over controls but the numbers are likely too small to reach statistical significance. 

My question is whether there is a method to see if the PRS and monogenic hits are statistically independent from each other. My hypothesis is that those with monogenic risk also have an elevated PRS and it is that which is what pushes them into having the phenotype as the OR of having disease in the presence of the monogenic variants is 2.5 with a penetrance of 0.28.

Hi r/bioinformatics!

Developing end-to-end computational infrastructure can get complex. For example, many of us might need help integrating AWS services and dealing with configuration, permissions, etc. At [Ploomber](https://ploomber.io/), we‚Äôve worked with many companies in a wide range of industries, such as energy, entertainment, computational chemistry, and genomics, so we are constantly looking for simple solutions to get them started with computational infrastructure in the cloud.

One of the solutions that have worked best for many companies we‚Äôve worked for is AWS Batch, a service that allows you to execute computational jobs on-demand without managing a cluster. It‚Äôs an excellent service for running computational workloads. However, getting a good end-to-end experience is still challenging, so we wrote a detailed blog post series.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z4i3suqd0ry91.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e72951087f9bbf58a4dd4274a0a47df9f71ae19

We are sharing this three-part series on deploying a Data Science Platform on AWS using our open-source software. By the end of the series, you‚Äôll be able to submit computational jobs to AWS scalable infrastructure with a single command.

The posts:

* [https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-i](https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-i) \- Use AWS Batch and test the infrastructure by executing a task in a container
* [https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-ii](https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-ii) \- Configure Amazon ECR to push a Docker image to AWS and configure an S3 bucket to write the output of Data Science experiments.
* [https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-iii](https://ploomber.io/blog/ds-platform-part-iii) \- Use Ploomber and Soopervisor (our open-source software) to run experiments in parallel and request resources dynamically (CPUs, RAM, and GPUs).

AWS Batch strikes a good balance between ease of use and functionality. However, we‚Äôve learned a few things to optimize it (for example, to reduce container startup time), so we might add a fourth part to the series.

If you‚Äôve previously used AWS Batch, please share your experience. We‚Äôd love to learn from you!

bioinformatics,"Greetings,

A former molecular biologist here. 

To make a long story short: I have been a ""hands-on"" wet-lab person for all my years in academia (Ph.D + research associate). I really enjoyed experimental work. When I quit academia, I thought that I will be able to ""sell"" my wet-lab skills in biotech industry (or somewhere near the biotech), because I did a lot of work with protein purification and analysis. Unfortunately, it did not happen. It is regrettable, because years of hard learning were lost, but I cannot do anything about it. My current position is somewhat related to life sciences, but I am unhappy with it and contemplating a career change into something ""computational"".

To be clear: I understand that a bootcamp will not make me a software developer. I do not have a CS degree and have no interest in going back to ""school"". Right now I am trying to understand the ""landscape"" and find what can provide a reasonable ""return on investment"". I would like to get somewhat ""employable"", break into a new field and keep developing there.

Since I am a former biologist, the idea of ""bioinformatics"" came to my mind. However, looking at it closer, I do not think that it will work for me. As I understand, bioinformatics is a mature field now, there is plenty of specialized degrees (M.Sc and Ph.D's) in bioinformatics in top-tier universities, it does require a lot of specialized knowledge (CS plus hard-core math and statistics). As far as I can see, there is more ""informatics"" that ""bio"" in bioinformatics. Realistically, I do not think that I can make myself competitive by self-education (in my spare time) and within reasonable timeframe (1-2 years). I would love to hear your thoughts, though. 

**The second question is somewhat counterintuitive**: could you recommend the most basic bioinformatics projects that even an absolute beginner can do? I am badly missing experimental work in the lab and, unfortunately, I do not have even a back-yard garden or a mini-greenhouse! The only place where I can experiments is my laptop.",Is there such thing as a self-taught bioinformatician?,1667888694

bioinformatics,"Hi,

I am running DESeq2 on my data, but I am not sure what design model should I feed DESeq2.

My project has 4 variables: age, sex, genotype, treatment. We are mostly interested in the interactions between genotype and treatment during adulthood, but we have some untreated data at young time. Sex is just a covariate and we are not interested in it.

- Young  
  - Untreated  
    - WT &amp; Mut  (mix of Males &amp; Females in both groups)  
- Old  
  - Untreated  
    - WT &amp; Mut  (mix of Males &amp; Females in both groups)  
  - Treated  
    - WT &amp; Mut  (mix of Males &amp; Females in both groups)  

Following DESeq2's vignette, I've tried creating a variable ""modelVar"" = paste0(age,""_"",genotype,""_"",treatment). I have also tried several approaches:

- Use all samples together
   - design = ~ modelVar
      - Coefficient = Old_WT_Treated_vs_Old_WT_Untreated
          - UPregulated DEG: 27  
          - DOWNregulated DEG: 71

- Use all samples together
   - design = ~ modelVar **+ sex**
      - Coefficient = Old_WT_Treated_vs_Old_WT_Untreated
          - UPregulated DEG: 42 
          - DOWNregulated DEG: 84

[Some comments in previous similar threads suggested](https://old.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/ydfofi/deseq2_design_consideration/ittmu23/) to use only the samples of interest to remove extra variance from the model.

- Use **only Adult WT samples** (subset the matrix and metadata when building the DESeq2 object)
   - design = **~ treatment**
      - Coefficient = Treated_vs_Untreated
          - UPregulated DEG: 75 
          - DOWNregulated DEG: 134

- Use only Adult WT samples (subset the matrix and metadata when building the DESeq2 object)
   - design = ~ treatment **+ sex**
      - Coefficient = Treated_vs_Untreated
          - UPregulated DEG: 97 
          - DOWNregulated DEG: 178

Which model/approach should I use? Which design, and which data filtering?

We are mostly interested on seeing:
- Effect of genotype (WT vs Mut) in young  
- Effect of age in genotype (untreated) (Young_WT vs Old_WT,  Young_Mut vs Old_Mut). Maybe here I should do a age:genotype?  
- Effect of treatment in adult genotype (Adult_WT_Untreated vs Adult_WT_Treated, Adult_Mut_Untreated vs Adult_Mut_Treated). Maybe here another interaction genotype:treatment ?

I'm not 100% sold on using interaction terms. Although on principle they might look good, will they be easily interpretable? 
Creating a model with ""design = ~treatment+genotype+treatment:genotype+sex"" gives me the following results:
&gt; resultsNames(ddsm) 
[1] ""Intercept""     ""treatment_Treated_vs_Untreated"" ""genotype_Mut_vs_WT"" ""sex_F_vs_M""    ""treatmentTreated.genotypeMut""

If I understand this correctly, these factors mean:
- ""treatment_Treated_vs_Untreated"": Effect of Treated on WT samples  
- ""genotype_Mut_vs_WT"": Effect of genotype on Untreated samples  
- ""sex_F_vs_M"": effect of sex on Untreated WT samples?
- ""treatmentTreated.genotypeMut"": effect of Treated on Mut samples? 

So, to compare, WT_untreated vs Mut_treated should I do add up the results of ""treatment_Treated_vs_Untreated""+""genotype_Mut_vs_WT""+""treatmentTreated.genotypeMut"" like in a linear model?

bioinformatics,"Hello fellow bioinformaticians! I wanted to share a little bit of my experience delving into the world of bioinformatics with y'all. I think my story might resonate with people from non-CS backgrounds who transitioned into bioinformatics.

I recently just graduated from BSc majoring in genomics and bioinformatics. Although my degree might sound like I have a lot of experience in bioinformatics, in reality, my undergraduate course is more genomics than bioinformatics. We were barely taught any Python and R. My journey with bioinformatics happened mainly during the pandemic. Before the lockdowns, I was looking forward to doing lab internships and was so excited for it. Sadly the opportunity was gone when most labs closed down and a lot of undergraduate students were left stranded not knowing what to do for their internships. I went on to do my internship with a startup and eventually did a lot of coding for them. I had a keen interest in deep learning and developed some Tensorflow object detection models to deploy in a dotnet environment. I remember questioning myself if doing any of this would help in my scientific career. I was also slightly envious of my friends who managed to get internship placements in labs. At the same time I also felt out of place doing coding since I don't have a CS degree. I have a lot of friends who were doing CS in the same university and I always question myself if I should just give up on biology and just go fully into CS, which is probably a more lucrative option career-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to my Honours year where I had to carry out my own research project, the lockdowns were still there in my country. I had a very difficult choice in picking a research project since it was risky to commit fully to a wet lab-based project. I eventually did a heavy dry-lab project and well, I can say that I fell in love with bioinformatics and really enjoyed it! My project didn't exactly have a good basis tbh (a lot of conjectures) but playing around with public datasets and just using all the various bioinformatics tools out there, writing my own scripts, thinking about what each output means and how they connect to form my hypothesis. I just felt like I was doing science, except it's on a computer. I eventually developed a keen interest in bioinformatics algorithms (Ohhh gosh the book by Philip Compeau &amp; Pavel Pevzner is sooo good!). I think bit by bit, I started to feel like I'm not out of place. I'm a scientist who's solving biological questions, just not through pipettes and centrifuges, but through applying various methods of data analysis on large biological datasets.

So for those of you who are thinking of going into bioinformatics from a non-CS background, never doubt yourself or be intimidated by all the coding you have to learn. The challenge may seem insurmountable in the beginning, but you're not alone in this journey!

It would touch on some general areas, like tissue and cell engineering, biomechanics, and neural engineering, but also get very specialized, since quantum biology engineering doesn't have much research on it yet.

biotech,"Hi! I'm a graduating senior and masters student. I study bioengineering and have done research &amp; independent projects in a tissue engineering wet-lab for more than 2 years, and I'm looking for research relevant positions in pharma/biotech companies/startup in the industry. I have no strong preferences, but I would like to do something related to research (bioengineering, wetlab, product development, drug delivery, gene therapy, etc) and hopefully have good control over experiments (something that's not super repetitive-like only being responsible for running the same assays every day).

These are some questions:

1) What are some position titles/companies people recommend to look for (for a non PhD)?

2) Has anyone done anything that involves engineering principles + research in biotech? (I guess more quantitative, or wet-lab but not only doing pure bio things etc) What do you think was different compared to a position that doesn't have the ""engineering"" aspect of things? -Or does that exist?

3) It would be great to share your experiences as a research employee in a company!   
Was it repetitive? Did the size of your company matter? (is it true that you get less freedom in your work in a bigger company) Is pharma work less interesting compared to biotech in your experience?

I currently have a team of people that I manage that have been trained to do synthesis. It is a mix of PhD, MS, and BS chemists. The PhD and MS employees have gotten to that level with the intent of making a career out of organic chemistry. Currently, the BS chemists on our team have been trained to do Organic Synthesis (all techniques learned from previous research stints and from time in our laboratory: ochem techniques, different reactions, NMR, LCMS, HPLC, etc.), however they are fresh out of school (1 year of experience). I have a lot of visibility from the senior level employees because they plan to stay in this field, however after discussing edp with current BS level, I am unsure whether they plan to stay in this field and have visibility that they may look for newer opportunities mid to next year. Our work is bare bolts Ochem and is great for exceling the careers for people that eventually plan to do medicinal chemistry or process chemistry as careers. Fresh BS graduates with 1 year synthesis experience might have a harder time competing for other jobs in this field unless they have more years of experience or go back to graduate school, so I want to try to help them bolster their resumes.

I am completely sympathetic to my BS employees and want to set them up for success outside of this job for their future opportunities. I am brainstorming to think of additional things I can have them do (webinars, trainings, corporate or business types of work, or additional types of work that are valuable in both industry and academia) to bolster their resumes to be more competitive for their future job searches. They most definitely will present resumes that include the usual ochem stuff, which is great if they are applying for those jobs, but I also want to help give them a wider breadth of things to learn so that they can broaden their horizons/scope for their future job search, should they decide they want to make a lateral move, go back to graduate school for chemistry/biotech, go into business side of things, or get into a different field.

biotech,"Greetings,

I understand that this is a bit vague question, but I cannot find better wording for it. My background: I am located in Canada, working in a public sector job, which pays somewhat reasonably (high 5-figure salary). However, there are many downsides to the job: the job is way less stable than what I hoped for; resources are extremely limited and I am essentially pigeonholed. I have been thinking about starting job search again. 

On the second thought, I am not familiar with the pay scale in biotech industry, I do not know whether I will get a better deal in the industry (especially in Canada -- there is only a handful of biotech companies and a lot of them have 2-star abysmal reviews on Glassdoor). It seems that the economy is headed into the recession, the cost of living is going through the roof, there are no stability guarantees in the industry either, career growth isn't guaranteed either. Plus, I fall into ""over-qualified, but under-experienced"" category. 

**My question**: could people here give some examples of a pay-scale in their company? Something like $15 / hr for a technician on the low-ed. $40 / hr for manager on the high-end, &gt;$100 for CEO (made-up numbers).

biotech,"In 2007 a team of scientists noticed that 31 people with right-sided hearing loss died suddenly in their sleep. They said that hearing loss is a cause of sudden death during sleep, since the inner ear hair cells - microscopic, sound detecting cells in the middle ear (***not to be confused with visible hairs that you can see***) - act as respiratory chemoreceptors that stimulate autonomic breathing. They then patented a device which wakes deaf people up if the device detects breathing problems during sleep. The same team of scientists later proved this hypothesis (that hair cells are respiratory chemoreceptors) in experiments on mice, 3 years after creating the patent. After doing these experiments, they said that in humans, damage or loss of these hair cells will cause death from respiratory failure.

What about people who are completely deaf then, such as Hellen Keller? She went completely deaf when she was a child and she lived until she was 87 years old.

How do scientists explain that? And why is any paper talking about hair cells being pivotal for breathing always authored by the same team of scientists? Why aren't other teams of scientists talking about this discovery?

Background info on corn stress cracks: When corn is harvested, its moisture content is too high to store. It's susceptible to pests and fungus. Corn is dried using heated air to reduce the moisture content from \~24% to \~13%. When dried too fast, tiny micro-cracks form around the dense starch granules and in the surrounding protein matrix of the horny endosperm.

I need help digesting jargon filled papers about corn's protein matrix. I found some about the mechanical strength of wheat due to puroindoline adhesion to remnants of the amyloplast membrane on starch granules after desiccation. But not anything I could understand about corn.

Some questions if anybody is interested in answering: Is the endosperm protein matrix strictly intracellular? What happens to endosperm cell walls after drying? When slicing a steak, I assume the knife cuts ""around"" the protein bodies and doesn't alter the quatenary structure. But if you dry out a piece of raw beef, how are the proteins affected by the moisture loss? What stains for zein are there? How do proteins travel through the gel in electrophoreisis?

Against:  
\- The opportunity cost of 3.5 - 4 years (and possibly my last bet for further education, the other option being trying my luck at a medical school)  
\- lack of job security / afraid of underemployment (unemployment is the least of my concern)  


For:  
\- Get to open more doors in the research sector (am very interested in the biotech sector, but immensely concerned about the biotech sector in Australia, everywhere I read on Reddit is doom and gloom), and confidently am not going into academia.  


I would hope that anyone out there can share their experience, particularly if they tried out industry research positions in Australia (or are still working). Like, is it super competitive to hold a position? Are they mostly contract positions as opposed to permanent positions?

At first I thought things  were going ok-ish, although it was strange for me that I was never  introduced to the ""team"" I was supposed to lead, just told I was  expected to get very close with the main person. The person seemed  completely not in the knowing that I was going to be in charge and it  was awkward. I accounted it to be because I just started and they wanted  me to onboard in peace before making it official. One meeting after 2  months, my manager tells me they want to phase out the woman and put me  in charge, she was everything bad in the book, faking data and unable to  do simplest things yada yada. I was not sure this was true but in the  same week she starts to act very deceptive and hiding towards me when  talking about results, not able to answer anything in a direct way.

I  thought this was a proof that she was dishonest and I start complaining  about her uncooperativeness and management asks me to find things that  proof her incompetence, seemingly super excited. I find loads of bad  data and BS, things that they have shown to investors as a quality data.  There is no way they didn't have a clue now when I think about it but I  didn't realize that at the moment because I thought very highly of my  manager. Then my direct manager quits with a week notice and I start to  answer to the CEO/founder. I quickly realize that this is a toxic,  manipulative, narcissist, micromanager who constantly checks up on me  and tries to control everything I do, even who I visit from work. I also  start to realize that the way the company is run, there is absolutely  no way not to have sloppy results and bad organization skills. Now they  blamed all the mess they made on her. I loose interest in becoming the  new scapegoat for the company and I decide to just hang in there for few  more months to collect money and GTF (i need it). New manager comes in,  unaware of everything it seems, I answer to him and the CEO.

But  now the tables have turned, the CEO has a suspicion that I am not in on it, my colleagues have become suspicious of me because I am constantly  showing some mistakes from the person in meetings (at the request of the  CEO) and I have had now two hostile meetings with my new manager and  CEO about my lack of collaboration with the others (oh I wonder why..).

biotech,"Okay. 
I've been looking into this a long time and I'm just no closer to picking a decision. 

I'm a prospective undergrad in Sri Lanka. 
I have the option of studying :

1. An MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) of 5 years ( +1.5 intern to become a licensed physician + 5 if I do a Post-grad and upgrade to consultancy - I'd pick either Neurology or Endocrinology, maybe even Pathology). 

2. A Biochemistry and Molecular Biology course (4 years) at the end of which through a competitive selection basis I can specialize in either the Bioc and Mol Bio, or Chemistry alone, or Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. I'd pick the latter specialization, which involves two industry-geared research projects of 3 months each. The Bioc and Mol Bio special has a six month academia-geared research. 
At the end of this course people have the opportunity of getting into PhDs, but it's again a competitive selection basis. I've heard they only take one or two from the Biotech special for PhDs, and that too only when it's a solo-research, which is uncommon in the field at the Uni. 


[If Uni status matters, the latter is offered only at one Uni in the entire country and it's well, the best in the country (lol). The former Uni is fairly mediocre when it comes to the MBBS course (The quality is good, but it doesn't have top tier recognition).]


I want to work in the Biotech industry, but I'm unsure about which sector. I like designing devices or researching/formulating compounds - so pharma, gene tech, sustainable dev - I'd like to get into that and more. I'm also interested in using AI for diagnostic tools and molecular level analysis. 

I feel like going down the MBBS path is more secure in the career progression sense, as the other path has a lot of competitive selection rounds and in general, research isn't always a success, so I can't guarantee I'll be able to work on something that'll draw interest. 
I'd also know a lot of the clinical aspect, the impacts/complexities in actual application if I end up in pharma or something similar. 
Plus, I've heard that MDs are favored when being selected for positions in the Biotech industry in some places. (An MBBS is similar to an MD). 
But I wonder if I would be venturing too far into a field away from the Biotech field that I want to work in. An MBBS is done technically to become a physician. I wouldn't abandon the practice entirely, but it wouldn't be my sole focus as a career later on in my late 30s. 
There's the added bonus that doing an MBBS means if I need to be away from the Biotech hubs, I'll still be able to work. And I do like Medicine, but ultimately Biotech is where my strongest passions lie. 


If I go along the 1st route straight into Biotech, I'll have to do a PhD and, tbh, I'm not sure I have the stamina to work on a single project for long. I like variety and a dynamic work culture and people and I can't imagine being stuck in academia, but I don't think you can get far in Biotech with an undergrad. 
There are also a lot of ifs in this path and although I have in the past been one of the best performing students in any given class, I'm not confident that will always be the case. I am passionate, and I work smart, but in the end, I could do everything right but still not have an appealing research/PhD/resume. 
To be honest, I'm just really undecided about the sector under Biotech I'd like to eventually work with, but right now I'm into Biochemistry, Genetics, Mol Bio, Microbiology, Calculus, programming and STEM in general and I'm into the idea of applying all of that for real-time solutions in the field. 
I understand that I could get into all this after an MBBS, but that's a really long time and I wonder if that commitment to Medicine is worth it. 
I do understand there's a valuable skill set to be gained in the Med pathway. Especially if I was to start my own Biotech start up or something similar. But is it worth the 7 to 12 years I could potentially end up spending on the MBBS?
Another concern with studying purely Biotech is that, even though I eventually want to work in Biotech, I don't much like the idea of being geographically restrained to the Biotech hubs. In case I have to move countries/cities, I want to be able to work in a related profession. 


Cost is not an issue for both paths. I wouldn't be able to privately afford a PhD, so those of us selected are selected for scholarships. 
While doing the Bioc course I'll be looking into internships as well. 

I think it might be important to mention, the Bioc course in Sri Lanka is severely underfunded and there aren't many facilities available. But it's not bad in terms of academic quality. 


I honestly can't decide which path to take and I don't have much time left to decide. 
A lot of people tell me an MBBS is the best path, but that advice is heavily biased as none of them are from the Biotech field, and I don't personally know anyone from the field.

I would like to try to get some advice on an idea that might be helpful as a service. Maybe something to have available on a company website. 

I was thinking of having a suggestion form for organisms. This would consist of a form that would consist of a temperature range, a preferred substrate, O2 levels etc. and then the form would spit back organisms that fit within those specifications. Maybe as time goes on it could link a few articles out the organisms use in industry? For example: 

I need a 

Eukaryote or Prokaryote: Eukaryote 

Optimum Temperature Range: 93-100 degrees farenheight

Required salts: (choose from a menu)

Growth medium: (choose from a menu)

I dream of working on drug discovery and development in the biotech industry. Mainly medicines and also drugs that can prevent hair loss and regrow hair.

The reason why I‚Äôm choosing a degree in Software Engineering over biotech is simply due to job security.

To my knowledge, it seems to be much easier to get a job with a degree in software engineering than biotech (at least where I‚Äôm living). Also, I have heard and read that the salary of a software developer tends to be higher than a biotechnologist. Essentially, I‚Äôm choosing software engineering because it seems like a safer route, also I love coding and have ever since I was in my preteens.

So, my question is: How do I go from a degree in software engineering to working on drug development? I want to combine AI &amp; ML in the drug industry. But I also want to be part of the actual research, like using pipettes and looking through a microscope, etc. I love microbiology and find it really fascinating.

Do I still need to include the first university? If not, how do I communicate on my resume that I started my PhD in 2019 regardless of university?

I‚Äôm a little nervous because I only included my current university but still stated I started in 2019 with my professor on my internship apps. I just thought it would have been crowded to include both institutions‚Äô education and work experience, so I lumped them together because it was the same work and same team (lab group).

its very frequent that 1.5mL / 15mL tubes containing biohazard waste are disposed of into plastic biohazard bins/bags which are then emptied into larger plastic biohazardous waste containers. the containers are often plastic and closable but nevertheless are not truly sealable, they are obviously not liquid-tight. into these containers are placed the 1.5 or 15mL tubes which often contain chemicals which are toxic / genotoxic / carcinogenic / mutagenic / etc. 

all of these residual small amount of chemicals go into a bag within a plastic container THAT DOES NOT SEAL. I repeat, if the container were to tip over, dozens of random chemicals and biohazardous materials would all pour out into the surrounding environment. And the handlers couldn't possibly know what is in there, because anything that is to be specifically labelled and done away with as such is supposed to go on its own into a separate hazardous chem waste container. 

the entire system does not make sense, because you are forbidden from putting a 1.5mL tube with biohazardous substances into a specific chemical waste stream. I have no idea how the industry operates in such a nonsensical manner but for anyone with half a brain in any major lab / EHS situation / OSHA situation / literally anyone in charge, this should be a gigantic red flag of something that is completely nonsensical. 

How could the entire idea of properly disposing of hazardous chemicals and biohazards be predicated on the idea that the containers never accidentally tip over? THE ENTIRE SYSTEM DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AND EVERY MAJOR LAB OPERATES LIKE THIS

A possible solution would be to have a combined hazardous chemical and biohazard waste stream that goes directly to an incinerator in the case that its safe to incinerate the chemicals, or another one otherwise.

biotech,"don't do much mouse stuff and have only just recently been engrossed in the wonders of transgenic mice and cre/lox systems. 

I have a few questions about generating transgenic mice. I'm writing a mock proposal so all this is hypothetical but must be feasible. 

I understand how cre-lox based knockout systems work to get cell type specific/conditional deletion. Eg cross mice with floxed gene with driver mice that express cre in cell specific or condition specific fashion. Cre is expressed and deletes what's between the loxp sites.

1)what sort of system could be used to get constitutive expression of gene X specifically in cell type Y? Gene X is endogenously expressed under some conditions in cell Y and other cells but I want constitutive expression in cell Y for a proof of concept experiment. Gene X is critical for development of other cells so selective expression in cell y won't work. 

2) My understanding is the Rosa26 locus is a good site to express your gene of interest. So I was thinking I could insert gene X in the rosa26 locus with a floxed stop sequence after the first exon(or somewhere else). Then I cross these mice with driver mice that express Cre under the control of a promoter that is critical and selective for Cell Y function. That way, in cell Y, Cre removes the stop sequence and gene X is expressed in(hopefully) large amounts. Would something like this work? My concern is that most people seem to use rosa26 for reporter proteins. So I'm guessing this is unfeasible? 

3) how does the crossing process actually work? I read about backcrossing and stuff but I'm confused about the purpose of it. Also among the offspring from your cross, how many are expected to have the desired recombination? Any good resources I can read (ideally that are fairly simplistic and not super technical)?

4) if you're writing a major grant (ie federal level) and are proposing generating a new transgenic mouse model to answer one of your research questions, how much detail do you need to go into the process? (pretend you're in academia again, not industry)

biotech,"

Like the title says, I feel, stuck.  For some background information~ I have a BS in microbiology and just graduated from grad school with a MS in biomedical science in August.  All summer I filled out DOZENS of job applications.  No one would bite other than entry level positions.  Unfortunately, I have never had a real professional science position. I worked at a glass factory seasonally during my BS and then for 8 months after getting my BS before going off to grad school.  So I have the bench work knowledge but not that ""professional"" experience employers are always after. 

In September, I ended up settling for lack of better terms, in a clinical lab tech position at the Mayo Clinic. It pays really well, and my coworkers are nice. It's even in the virology department! Sounds like I have it made right? 

Truth is I'm bored. My ideal career is a senior level research position, or a lab manager typed job at a University. Not clinical work.  I cannot relate to my coworkers about how they aren't here for the money ""it's all about the patients"" The environment is rather toxic here. Needs of the patient come first to the point where the workers bend over for the sake of ""helping people"".  I miss bench work.  Frankly I miss doing anything by hand.  All the assays we run are incredibly automated.  And when I ask questions about how the machine works etc. I'm met with ""lemme look into that"" because my coworkers don't actually care about the how and why something works. They are content with just getting a result.  The position I am in is not unlike my factory work.  Put on a run (assay), box and send out the glass (results).  

I recognize that it's just a temporary thing for a few years. I make really good money right now. And I need to have professional experience in a regulated lab. But I dread coming to work every day. I feel like I wasted my time with my MS since this job only requires a BS. It's hard to connect with coworkers when they are already in a job they were aiming for when I on the other hand cannot wait to leave.  

I can't tell if this is a rant or an actual question at this point. I guess....

I (26F) graduated at the start of this year with a master's degree in molecular biology. After that I did an internship in an academic lab  abroad and now I am stuck at home unemployed with zero clues what to do  with my life. Before my master's I wanted to do a phd but during my time at the lab I became seriously disillusioned by the academia, mostly because of the toxicity and the lack of money. I can't imagine being  stuck in a wet-lab my whole life being poor but I also can't imagine my  whole life being stuck in a lab, period.

I really wanted to live and work abroad but I can't do sales there without the knowledge of the language. Also, I don't yet hold a driving license and I need to  get that sorted out asap. This is why I can't look for sales jobs right now so I need to do something in the meantime.

My questions to you are:

1. Will a phd boost my chances of landing a pharma sales job? Will it make me look better to my future customers just because I have those three letters after my name?
2. If I do decide to do a phd, what should I do during it to make me better at sales and improve my chances of landing a job?

I'm an undergraduate (Junior) computer science student interested in Drug Discovery. My background includes previously interning at Genentech as a Computational Proteomics intern.

I'm currently having trouble deciding between two internship offers for Summer 2023. I received an offer from Merck within their Computational and Structural Chemistry (Drug Discovery) group in Boston and another offer for a Software Engineering internship with Walmart in Arkansas. I'm contemplating whether to pursue stability at Walmart versus the potential of a growing field at Merck (and other biotech companies). I have the potential to return to Walmart FTE if I successfully complete my project during the internship, but Merck doesn't provide intern to full-time conversions.

From my knowledge, it's hard to break into Drug Discovery without a graduate level education, so I would more than likely have to pursue a PhD to enter the field. However, I'm concerned about the time commitment a PhD would take and whether the incentives would be worth it over entering industry after receiving my Bachelor's degree.

Talking about your work is always easy as an academic and can pretty much expect how introductions can go, what kind of questions you might get  after talking a bit about what your project(s) are about because the only time I'd interact with people who knew just as much as me, or more, were people in my own lab. I'm also a pretty easy going person and can just go with the flow and roll with the punches, but I feel like I shouldn't be handling a job interview that way? So I'm here trying to get so anecdotal answers with my main question being, what kind of potentially \[more difficult questions\] could I get asked when interviewing for positions regarding protein expression and purification?

I have a difficult question and would really appreciate, if people could share their thoughts / experience.

I have started to consider a career change, since ""life science"" does not work for me. I have been through some hardships, caused by a low-quality employment in Canada. No mentorship, no professional development, no career growth! It is regrettable that I have to throw away all my experience in ""life science"", but I just cannot make it work! I would have even taken some teaching opportunities in Middle East, but I do not have enough qualification for these either! Shame... Cutting to the chase: I have read on a number of occasions that networking is key to finding employment or probing the hidden job market.

I am a (*former*) life science researcher in a very small and remote place in Canada. This is a huge problem for me! I simply do not have networking opportunities. Nearest big city is Vancouver, but I do not want to seek employment in Vancouver -- it is simply un-affordable for one-income person, unless I make 6-fig salary.
Next big city, sometimes dubbed as a biotech hub, is Seattle. Again, I do not know if going to some career fare there is worth spending several hundred dollars.

The only option I am left with is Internet / LinkedIn. At this point, I am interested in getting a few informational interviews across a number of domains. I would like to know what options are there, what skills are in demand, what can I expect with my background.

**I have following questions:**

- Who (what rank; job title) are people most likely to respond to a request for informational interview? In my current organization, these would be ""regional managers"" or people of similar rank.
- How to send a polite request for an informational interview? 
- How are informational interviews conducted these days? Via Zoom? Skype?
- Imagine that you are a professional on LinkedIn. How would you like/dislike to be approached by a complete stranger with an interview request on LinkedIn? Would you even entertain such a request?
- Have you ever been approached and asked for an interview? Have you given one yourself?

However, I recently interviewed for one post-doc that is extremely intriguing, as it is a public/private partnership doing exciting and industry-relevant research (related to formulation and drug delivery) in a low COL city (rent is 25-50% of Boston or SF) where I'd LOVE to be. The money is less (higher than NIH min but by no means comparable with a scientist position), but the cost of living is less. Not going to say it evens out, but I'd at least be comfortable.

Pros: Intellectual freedom, gain leadership/project management skills, gain ""industry experience"" in an academic setting, learn more industry relevant skills, relocate to geographical region of interest, might open up positions at companies that require/prefer post-docs or lead to scientist role at this company

3)As i said, i am really not sure if i can fake any pretences of being the best fit. I had maths and bio in highschool which is a rare thing here, and they teach you the more esoteric caveats of maths like derivatives and vectors, and a lot more. So i was offered electives on basic math and bio, which i had obviously covered before. Our credit system is a bit different that practical or lab study hours of 2.5 equate to just one credit. Its covered in the transcripts. But it still remains a nagging doubt in my head. We also covered physics and processes. Also intrumentation, but nothing like device engineering. If i craft a good statement of purpose would it help in me getting admitted me admitted to a prestigious university. Also i am studying up on python if that would help.

4) Any reccommendations or advice would be extremely appreciated, especially concerning a statement of purpose, or choice of school.

P.s. I have attached a cropped picture of my transcipt to indicate my subjects. Please peruse it.","Hello there, I am a Biotech undergrad and I plan to switch to biomedicene or biomedical engineering, and i have a lot of questions",1669129210
biotech,"The idea is that I have bee given observed tumor volume vs time data for xenograft in mice. I need to estimate tumor volume over time by optimizing a tumor growth function against this observed data.

The issue that I am having is that the data spans at most 14 days, which is not enough time to capture the particular growth dynamics of the tumor.

Within the scope of the data, tumor growth appears to be exponential but, as the tumor grows, it should switch to linear growth and asymptotically approach a maximum volume.

Is there some way to estimate the upper limit of tumor volume and/or a function that can accurately extrapolate tumor behavior?

Why do some drugs cost so much like monoclonal antibodies therapy  for diabetes and other like coronavirus vaccines a lot less?

biotech,"I‚Äôm going to preface this by saying that I suffer from severe anxiety. 

I randomly left my 11 year career to work in biotech. It was definitely a great decision, I make double what I did at my old career, and I work in cell and gene therapy and am thrilled to be at the forefront of this therapy. I have been at the company for 16 months. I have made a few mistakes, but nothing that has really had an impact on any product. 

Problem is, I have an insanely irrational fear of getting fired. My current dilemma is this: I ran a filter integrity test several times before I realized that the gas wasn‚Äôt on. When I turned the gas on, the integrity test passed right away. The problem is, I didn‚Äôt document the canceled tests. I thought since they were canceled and not failed that I didn‚Äôt need to document it. Don‚Äôt ask me what was going through my head, it was 5am, I was embarrassed that I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, and just‚Ä¶messed up. I owned up to my mistake, and was completely honest. I was supposed to document it, I didn‚Äôt, but the test passed and the media that was put through the filter expired and was disposed of. 

I realize I may be insane, but my manager told my supervisor that when I work with a certain person, there seems to be more mistakes than normal. I was spoken to about the mistakes, no big deal, just a quick meeting. My supe told me that she knows I‚Äôm a good operator and that I‚Äôve had a string of ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù with quality events and QA.

I‚Äôm petrified that when QA sees the mistake, I am going to get in trouble. My worst case scenario mindset tells me I‚Äôm going to be fired. As irrational as this sounds, I have been dealing with this my entire life. I do counseling and take some anxiety meds, but when it comes to work anxiety I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to deal.

I‚Äôm just looking for advice or validation I guess? I‚Äôve never seen anyone fired over a mistake in the 16 months I‚Äôve been there, but in my head they will say I did it on purpose and fire me.

I‚Äôm sorry if this is long completely irrational, but I guess I‚Äôm just looking for validation or others‚Äô experiences. I know I have mental illness, so I‚Äôm hoping that I‚Äôm way overthinking it. Advice please. TYIA.",Irrational fear of being reprimanded or fired,1668683718

I am currently trying to understand the direction of where I want to go next for my career. If it helps I have a PhD in immunology . I am in my first industry position in a small company and I hate it. I want to understand based on others experiences if how I am feeling is just a normal work culture I have to deal with, so that I can lower my expectations. 

I am a senior scientist with over 10 years of experience in academia (grad school + postdoc). Made the move to industry last year after eking out a paper. Took the first offer I had as I was expecting our first child.  

Fast forward I am wondering what do I want to do next and what should I expect. 

Currently: Company is small (32ppl w leadership) and has core hours of 10-4pm. No WFH options and is 35min average commute one way. The workload is a lot with constant pressure to keep up. No real guidance and it‚Äôs all about figure it out yourself attitude. I lead 2 programs with one more coming up and have an associate scientist who reports to me. I report directly to one of the cofounder. Leadership likes/wants employees‚Äô involvement in company affairs although there is no time besides your own work to do much of anything else. 

I am constantly stressed trying to keep up that I am thinking - is this typical? Being a new mom adds it‚Äôs own stress and so I want understand if I need to lower my expectations. 

If it helps, I am in onco immunology position so I do bench work and lots of analysis with organizing for the program needs.

We have quite a comparable cv, though he has about 5 years more experience since he's slightly older.

There is a constant need for him to one up most things i say, either by commenting on them (emails or even face to face), or rushing to take initiative on things that I propose. There is no confrontation, no direct ""you're wrong, this way is better"", but there is a constant need to show there is always a better way, and starts becoming quite annoying...

I already avoid interactions, but on occasions where professional activities require it, I cannot avoid. I've thought on how to deal with this and so far my perspective has been one of doing my job and that's it. Especially because there was never any direct confrontation.

Total shot in the dark but here goes...

I'm a consultant working on a research project for a company in the longevity space; they're contemplating rolling out an ""internal startup"" of sorts that would let customers track certain biomarkers and other personalized data.

One of the things we're exploring is whether there's a viable case for quantifiable cost-savings if customers from the ""Startup"" opt to also participate in a clinical trial offered by the parent co, as some of the already-gathered data may be useful.

I'm very much NOT an domain expert here on this specific part of it (clinical trials &amp; potential efficiencies thereof), but perhaps someone here is?

If so, I'd love to ask a few questions just to get a sense of what's actually plausible / sensible from a potential cost-savings basis, or whether this is even in the realm of reality.

biotech,"1990, which marked the beginning for research on the Human Genome Project https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project, also coincided with my travels to Iran. At the time, the country‚Äôs healthcare had greatly suffered as a result of the isolation the 8-year war with Iraq had created. My plans were to introduce the latest technologies in laboratory sciences and cardiovascular medicine. I had acquired exclusive licenses to represent several major healthcare companies including a new technology offered by J&amp;J that looked like a small and simple stainless steal tube called the ‚ÄúStent.‚Äú Stent was the latest technology in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
In 1991, when a team from J&amp;J Interventional Systems headed by an interventional cardiologist named Professor B.V. travelled to Iran to launch the Stent Technology, I met Dr .M.G.. He was completing his fellowship in interventional cardiology. After several days, Prof B.V. identified him as the only specialist worthy of receiving a certificate in stenting. He noted that, while M.G.can be a leader in any European country including the US, the rest of the cardiologists needed to receive proper training in angioplasty before advancing to Stent implementation. Professor B.V. travelled to Iran twice more and trained many of the other cardiologists in proper techniques for angioplasty and stenting. Eventually, together with Prof. B.V.and Dr. M.G.‚Äôs support, it wasn‚Äôt long before we are able to bring Iran to a front in angioplasty and stenting.
In 1995, After the bombing at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, President Clinton Issued the following:
Executive order 12957 of 15 March 1995, banned US investment in Iran‚Äôs energy sector and executive order 12959 of May 1995, banned US trade with and investments in Iran. The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act was (ILSA) was signed in August 1996, (HR 3107 P.L. 104172)
I received official notification from all the companies I represented that my licenses had been revoked.
At the time I was engaged in the planning and implementation of 2 healthcare projects. The First, was a Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory; with Dr. M.G, and his group of cardiologists together with the Board of Directors at a private Hospital in Tehran . At the time, M.G.‚Äòs abilities as a cardiologist had resulted in him being exploited by his professors and other members of the Iranian Heart Association. A private working environment would have offered him the security he needed to advance without the fear of indefinite exploitation. The other project, involved a production laboratory for diagnostic tests. More specifically, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ELISA KITS. That project included the participation of an immunologist named Dr. N.D. and the partners in
   
Iran‚Äôs largest private diagnostic and anatomical Pathology laboratory, of whom my mother was the most influential member. It was intended to reduce Iran‚Äôs dependence on foreign imports.
When the sanctions were announced, both projects were still in their infancy. The terms of the sanctions stated that, unless all goods and pending projects inside the US are complete and out of the country within 30 days, they must be abandoned. That significantly reduced the amount of time required to complete the CATHlab and, therefore, reduced the expectation for the unit to function properly and reliably. Unfortunately , there was nothing anyone could do. Luckily, I would still have been able to comply and deliver the missing parts after the installation. Both projects were on their way to Italy with Iran as it‚Äôs final destination one day before the deadline. Upon installation, the Cathlab required me to travel 22 times between Tehran and San Diego including the need to have an expert engineer from the facility to travel to Tehran before it was fully completely operational.
The ELISA production lab, took 2 more years before it was completed. Luckily , I was able to fulfill my obligations both to my partners as well as the sanctions. Once complete, I returned to the US and begin focusing on my inventions.
After my final departure from Iran. The two people who had benefited most from having me in their lives, Doctors MG &amp; ND decided to show their gratitude for all that I done for them over the years. They did that by taking full advantage of my absence and getting involved with the World Genome Project. To bypass the restrictions the sanctions had placed on foreign investment into Iran, they had decided to honor me by giving me the long overdue credit for all my hard work. They introduced my name and moved forward with negotiations with some of the largest pharmaceutical and healthcare companies in the world. I had no idea how much value they believed I added when they continued putting my name and signature. I was, without even realizing, the one whose name had the power of God. I was H.A. CEO of PTE; who lives in San Diego , CA.
12 years and $3Billion later, marked the start of The International Genome Project including the Iran Gene project under the direction of Dr. P.S. and several other scientists from Stanford &amp; Harvard Universities and the CTO of a San diego based gene-sequencing corporation.
Dr. MG immigrated to Toronto, and started a collaboration with the University of Toronto to collect all data from the Iran Genome Project &amp; continued working with Dr. N.G. on all the clinical trials and the research they had started.",The Iranian Gene Sequencing Project (corrupt scientist &amp; big Pharma exposed) part1.,1668554917

biotech,"I'm a medical student with many years of research experience (I may even enter my schools MD/PhD program) and am interested in stem cell therapy and artifical organs. I don't want to practice clinical medicine; my goal post-training is to join a start up that is focusing on stem cell therapy or artificial organs (which I have research experience in).

I'm wondering if the added years of specialization (typically 2 years minimum) is a good use of time if I want to join a start-up? For example, it seems to me that a 3 year internal medicine residency (where you spend months at a time individual departments such as nephrology, cardiology, etc.) Would give me more than enough experience to be able to ""think clinically"" and relate that experience to whatever project is being worked on (e.g. heart of kidney stem cell therapy or artifical organ). Similarly, it would give me a completely different skillet than a PhD. 

Similarly, I wonder if specialization would make me less marketable (e.g. if I become a cardiologist, then I'll only be hired for jobs that involve the heart, whereas in reality a cardiologist also finished med school and internal medicine and should have plenty of knowledge to be useful in topics related to the kidney). I'd guess an internal medicine doctor could pitch themselves to work on any project? 

Thoughts? IMO it seems like larger companies want super specalist in everything, but a start up would be fine with a generalist? Also it seems like I'd be a better scientist/contributor to a start-up by joining one than specializing forever (e.g. knowledge learned from joining a start up that fails in 2 years &gt; knowledge that will benefit a start up by doing 2 more years of medical training).",Is medical specialization a waste of time?,1668526709

I am a senior in university and I have a dilemma. I currently have two offers for a 6 month co-op opportunity at Bristol Myers and Catalent. A little bit about the two offers:

&amp;#x200B;

BMS - 6 month R&amp;D co-op, 25 min commute, higher pay ($10 more /hour than Catalent), definitely the more convenient and better offer on paper but the issue here is that long-term I do not see myself pursuing a career in R&amp;D and I have no intentions of getting a PhD, which from what I hear is absolutely necessary to make it in R&amp;D. I do find research interesting but working in a lab and working odd hours is not for me. For context, I do have some R&amp;D experience as a biotechnology major. 

&amp;#x200B;

Catalent - 6 month QA/QC co-op, requires me relocating to Maryland (4 hours away), lowest pay I have ever been offered, inconvenient BUT I have been extremely interested in pursuing a career in regulatory affairs and from what I hear, QA/QC does give you some technical experience in the regulatory and compliance side of therapeutic development. For context, I have no experience in regulatory and it has been really hard for me-as someone whose profile is on the R&amp;D track- to find any experience in anything related to regulatory and compliance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have several people telling me that QA is extremely repetitive and boring and will not be as relevant of an experience for reg affairs as I hope. I have other people telling me that it is hard to transition from R&amp;D to regulatory, unless you have been in R&amp;D for a while (I don't want to be stuck in R&amp;D for a while). People are also telling me that BMS has more notoriety than Catalent which is why I should pick the BMS one and then potentially try transitioning into regulatory internally, once I have worked there for a while. A little bit more personal context, I have never really been far from home. I went to college in-state and all my friends and family are here, which is why I am a little nervous about moving away for the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think some of the questions I have are if QA/QC will actually be worth checking out for someone trying to move into regulatory, and if it is better to gain this experience rather than doing R&amp;D for a while, potentially getting a RAPS certification/Master's and then immediately jumping to regulatory. As someone who has been doing research for a while, I do find research really interesting but I know I cannot see myself working in a lab long term. What kind of experience does regulatory affairs value more? Do they want individuals with a more technical understanding of the research and development process, or do they want someone who can perform the technical tasks such as compliance reviews and audits?  I cannot tell which path/company would be better to get me to my end goal, which is why I would really appreciate some advice!",Which offer should I take?,1668373907
biotech,"Greetings,

A life scientist (Ph.D.) here. I would like to ask a quick question (my apologies for an off-topic): 

**has anyone reading this has found employment either in biotech industry or close to it by using career services / coaching from ""BEYOND THE PROFESSORIATE: PHD CAREER TRAINING PLATFORM"" ?**

To make a long story short: either within academia (before) or near academia (now) I have been unhappy and it really wears on me. I have tried to build on my ""academic heritage"" (as much as I could), rather than completely toss it away. I believe that, ideally, one's career and the resume should be ""explainable"" and ""coherent"", so that one sounds convincing to a recruiter.

But even finding a job of academic research ""facilitator"" in a non-research organization doesn't seem to work for me. I think that, basically, I had had a very bad start that was followed by a vicious cycle of low-quality employment.

Maybe a complete career change is the solution, indeed? Sometimes I feel completely at loss and, though no longer in academia, feel that I could benefic from ""career training for Ph.Ds."" 

SO far I found a couple of such services. One is ""Cheeky Scientist"", however, I have done some and their reputation does not impress me. Maybe they helped some people, but I will definitely not be reaching out to them.

Another one I came across is this ""Beyond Professoriate"" program by L. Maren Wood, PhD. I have glanced over the web-site, but it does not look convincing to me.

**Questions:**

- Has anyone here used this BEYOND THE PROFESSORIATE career counselling and it helped you to find a job in industry? What type of job?
- Is it worth the money? Or is it another ""self-help"" book, just priced at $500?
- Is there any career ""know-how"" or is it the same ""fluff"", just packaged differently?
- Could one get the content of this course by doing his own research, more or less?","Has anyone used ""Beyond Professoriate"" career services?",1668370238

i studied finance in college and have been working as a consultant since graduation (6 months). I configure/train mid and large sized companies on finance/accounting software. The great thing about this job, is that it exposes me to financial and operational practices across multiple industries.

biotech,"I am currently learning to be a deviation approver. As QA Floor support, when it comes to deviations, I review Deviation assessment and approve anything minor and above before it gets push forward to our deviation investigation team for root cause analysis. anything below a minor, it gets reviewed and closed with my team.

one of the things that i am struggling with is the justification portion of deviations. When it comes to yes/no impact to the product itself, its pretty straightforward. but data integrity ones are making me struggle on justifying why root cause is required, why its a No Impact Event Notice, etc etc.

When it comes to impact to product in regards to SISPQ, theres a bunch of reports, documents, supporting supplemental records, etc that guides you on if there is impact or not. but it feels like with data integrity, there are very little. and the Final Justification is very crude.

for example. lets say a weekly cleaning is required for XYZ in an ISO room. and an operator forgot to document a cleaning that was performed in an ISO environment. and it was discovered the next week by someone reviewing logbooks. What justification would it be in terms of data integrity on what this classification should be? currently i feel like people at my work talks on behalf of SISPQ when it comes to data integrity. which makes no sense to me at all? as it should be talking about the validity of the data (as it straight up violates ALCOA+.), and not impact to product. as that has its own section.

another example. Missed performer on a part of an operation. and there are no ways to verify it. (other than the fact that the operation got done) this would also be a deviation. but how would you justify the data integrity part? would it be a minor? lower classification? higher? and what is the justification?

at my current job, it seems to be majority of the people would probably close both of these events as a class lower than minor (idk what you guys would call it at your company. my company calls them ""event notice"").

the justifications i would see are 

1. for the first example. ""there is no impact to SISPQ as this is a weekly cleaning requirement performed when there are no operations ongoing and product is not in the room.""

""there is impact to data integrity however it is low risk as there is no impact to product due to weekly cleanings are performed while products are not in the room""

for the second example. justifications i would commonly see.

2. There is no known or potential impact to SISPQ as the concentration sample of the cells are within expect parameters at the end of this [operation].

""there is impact to data integrity but it is low risk as the operation was able to be completed expected and the sample concentrations are within parameters"".

(NOTE: quick caveat. i am substituting the operations name to ""operation"" to not give potential information away of where i work. but this operation wouldnt be the end of the full operation, as there are still X Y Z operations done on each day. this would just be 1 of those operations thats performed before we get a final product. so the data received is not referring to things such as sterility, final expected parameters, QC test results, etc)


so these may be bad examples. and these are NOT real examples ive seen. but kind of similar to the justifications i see when it comes to data integrity.

i struggle with this because again, these 2 examples are clear cut deviations due to data integrity. but the deviation justification for closing it as a minor/event notice/major/etc etc speaks on behalf of the operation/product instead of about the data or ALCOA+.

how can i get a better understanding of on approaching data integrity related issues? other than only knowing as a ""yes/no that is a data issue""? and being able to justify what level of issue it is?",QA Shop Floor. Currently learning Deviation Approver. Advice please,1668205739

biotech,"I'm a laboratory technician working in a DNA Lab. I've been working on repairing two photospectrometry machines, old tech but very effective. There are only a handful of repair technicians (3 or 4) that actually work on these machines, myself becoming one only just recently after tinkering and under tutelage of an experienced engineer for a while now.
The engineer relayed how crucial and priceless the information and methods he's taught me when working with these machines is, he himself running a business off of it, to my surprise even extending an offer to work for him and travel to do on-site repairs.

I'm inclined to leave my company because the past two years have been an overload of responsibilities, one after the other, piling on work from different departments and different titles without (and correct me if I'm wrong, but, to my belief) proper compensation, no promotion, no raise, and standard quarterly bonuses. I'm not complaining about the work itself, on the contrary, I'm an individual that enjoys staying busy, learning, and diversifying my skills, etc.
However, I bring up the salary issue to my boss and he brushes it off saying they already pay me well enough, when in reality I make well below what a technician or on-site engineer would make. To put figures on the board, my salary contract says 57k, and I get roughly 2k-2.5k every quarter, bringing it to an average of 66k annually.

I work on all kinds of biotech systems at this company, from HPLCs and ESI systems, to Photospectrometry Mass Specs and other Shimdazu and Dr.Oligo synthesis and purification machines.

Forgive my ranting, this all converges on the main issue somehow.
But I digress.

My company has two of these behemoth machines, with two more on the way. After successfully resurrecting one, testing, and putting it back into our production line, my company requests that I make an easily accessible and comprehensive SOP for future troubleshooting.

I'm actively looking for a better offer and work environment to jump ship from this one. Preferably into the programming sphere, but I absolutely wouldn't mind being a service engineer and travel to fix machines like the ones I'm working on now.

I felt like the interview went badly. They asked me a lot of science questions and I fumbled my way through answering them. For example, they asked if I were to ligate three DNA fragments together how would I go about doing that? I gave a wishy washy answer about restriction enzymes and ligases and that's about it.   


One of the interviewers was visibly judging me for my lack of certainty/experience. The other interviewers were either more understanding or inscrutable. I confessed to them that I'm more of a follower-type personality and I seldom come up with science things completely on my own. It's usually through the guidance of a PI or scientist. They told me they'll get back to me within two weeks but I feel like I just bombed the interview and that I'm an imposter of a researcher.

biotech,"Help! I am a new PhD grad, and I recently finished my job hunt which resulted in 4 offers.

There is a clear winner in terms of compensation and the role itself, company D. I do not think negotiating offers A-C will make them more enticing or change my mind.

What is the proper etiquette in declining offers? I want to keep these relationships positive for future opportunities, and loved the people I met at all the companies. If I know I want to go with D, do I accept it first and then notify A-C? This removes the possibility of getting counter offers, but would this also offend anyone?

Example: 
I had a fantastic experience interviewing and visiting company A and thought I would take their offer but I made no promises. Now that I know I want to go with D, I feel a professional courtesy would be to let the hiring manager at A know I received a competing offer I plan to accept and why.  They‚Äôd get a chance to counter but I also don‚Äôt want to waste their time knowing I‚Äôll still go with D.

My friends say not to do that, and that being too transparent could be potentially harmful to me. They say accept D then decline A-C. I don‚Äôt want to burn bridges, so what‚Äôs the most appropriate thing to do?

I have been the unwilling witness to the decline of my lab over the past two years. You could blame covid, but the newer graduate students were admitted into the program before that happened and they were poor workers right off the bat. After the big 2020 quarantine  when lab work started up again, we lost the good student workers we had to graduation (why couldnt they all have been super seniors). Now, any new students have followed the lead of the newer graduate students, and what communication and teamwork used to be there is now gone. I can't ask people to do anything and rely on it happening. I can't update people on new lab procedure without it being ignored/forgotten or somehow taken negatively. They were not receptive to training and had to be trained multiple times where in the past I have only needed to go over tasks 2-3times before they got it down. 
 I was doing 90% of the shared work in the lab for a year before mental health and inability to perform my own thesis work caused me to reevaluate and start therapy. I am devastated at the state of the lab I once loved to work in a year after the changes I made to better mental state. I was separated from my original lab space due to university appointed mediation to get me away from one graduate that was treating me particularly terribly.  Since then I have taken a step back from cleaning and maintaining the lab space to focus on the work i need to do to graduate. It is so sad how poorly the space and my PI is being treated by these newer students. As the senior graduate I tried so hard to step up to the role and maintain the status quo. I was the person to go to the in lab, heck even other graduates from other labs often asked to help with microscope work or how to go about an experiment. What did I do? Why am I all of the sudden a villain when my work and help used to be appreciated? 

I now only do what I need to do for my thesis work. I only clean what I make dirty. I only make solutions as I need them (though I make extra because I Can't Stop). Ive separated myself from the space as best I can and from the rude people that are now in the program. I still even clean up after them and their mistakes because i cant just STOP. I can't let go of my anger and sadness over the loss of what was a great work environment. I'm not a solitary creature; all of this is against my personality. I pray to the void that this isn't how it will be when I find a job after I graduate. This isn't normal. It can't be or I'll return myself to the void today because none of this is worth it. If if I don't get a high paying job that my degree will grant me then I won't be able to afford to live anyways. My therapist says I just need to get out of here.

TLDR: Is it possible for bacteria contaminent from air in a room to destroy, or impact a DNA oligonucleotide that is suspended in saline solution and stored at around 1 degrees celsius? Is the ribose in the synthetic DNA a possible food source for any bacteria, even if there is minimal oxygen and its too cold for bacteria to grow at the moment, im more speaking as a matter of principle

Hi everyone, I am running an experiment with this Synthetic Singe Stranded Oligonucleotide: [https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/134160274](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/134160274) d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG) . Received as salt, now in saline.

I have suspended it in Saline Solution (1 gram in 50ml 0.9 % sterile Saline). In doing so i noticed that there was a **contaminant** in the solution after. It was as sterile an environment as I could make it, but it was a small black lump of something, no idea what it was. **Please note I am a hobby enthusiast wanting to get some data about something, im sorry I dont have a lab!** Wish i did! My environment was clean though and i wore full PPE and loads of alcohol cleaning etc. I was able to draw it out whilst using a sterile drawing needle, but in that time it would have been exposed to air as well as this contaminent for quite some time. Its sealed and safe, but I am unable to filter immediately as I have the wrong gear. I will have to wait 24 hours until some stuff is delivered tomorrow. I wish I hadnt made this error but its done now.

This is for a in vitro experiment (not human) and i now need to ensure that my risk of this product is as low as possible. Im not in a position to throw it out and get a new product, so I would rather save this if I can. Its stored in the fridge in a sterile container in a few bags away from food and in a box, and its completely sealed in a sterile syringe. I was unable to filter it today as I have the wrong sized filter, but I have some coming tomorrow and any bacteria would be filtered out within 24hours ish of any contaminent - with around 23 hours of that being stored in 1 degrees celcius (33.8 faternheit)

Is my product totally fucked, or will it be fine after being filtered? I assumed that bacteria could not feed off a Synthetic Single Stranded Oligo, but what about the nucleotide? This synthetic DNA is a deoxy-acid, could ribose be an issume? I had the assumption that the salt in the saline solution would NOT be a good place for common household bacteria such as E coli or strep or something but that might not be true.  the very minimal oxygen that would be in it could hurt growth, as would the cold temperature. But reading the literature the common denominator is that cold is bad for bacteria, salt water not so much. Still I want my risk RAMP to be as good as i can get it.
