i'm working on a moth and often have snp variants that are adjacent to each other. i am looking to annotate these variants to get a sense of what they do. i been mostly using snpeff but am having a problem with adjacent snps which get called independently, rather than as one combined variant, often leading to incorrect predictions like stop codons in the middle of proteins (when it's actually a mis-sense mutant when read together, as in the case below).

i am planning on running a microarray metanalysis on a number of sets, however the raw cel files for all of these are not available. when i have run a microarray metanalysis in the past i have always started from raw cel files and performed the same normalisations etc on all sets rather than using the series matrix files available from geo (which i understand to be summaries of the experiment including normalisation etc performed by the original authors of the study).

bioinformatics,"hello, 

i been looking at some refseq records and have come across some incomplete cds annotations.  however, i'm slightly confused as to how they got picked up, given they seem to lack start/stop codons.  for example, sd37\_rs10635 and rs41900 in gcf\_000943515.2 (nz\_cp016174) don't seem to have a start or stop codon - they begin/end with tgc/cgc and ccc/gaa respectively.  when i visualise them in snapgene (arrows = predicted cds), they look like this:



[sd37\_rs10635 and rs41900 in gcf\_000943515.2 \(nz\_cp016174\)](
when i used blastx it seemed to corroborate the annotated sequences for these proteins, to the degree that blast hits align along the annotated region and not the snapgene-predicted cds regions that aren't part of the annotated cds.  however, i'm not sure how convincing this is - it says the annotated region is most similar to other blast base entries, but presumably the query could simply be a novel version of a base protein.  

in other cases (where the protein was in a bgc and could be compared to homologs in homologous bgcs with the same synteny) it looks like the annotation is wrong and one protein has been broken into several bits.  for example, sd37\_rs42595 looks like it should be part of a bigger protein (orange arrow), and when i blast that i get the protein i would expect (a pks) with complete query coverage.:

can anyone answer (i) why cds without start and stop codons are being annotated and (ii) how far they would trust the annotations?  how would you normally deal with this - would you take the annotated sequence as the true protein, or extend/truncate the annotated protein either end until it matches the snapgene cds for the annotated protein?

from a background perspective, my pi in grad school got a grant that required computational work but they did not have any experience in that field. my postdoc pi was a wetlab scientist that mostly used guis. most of my computational work was self taught, though i did take one class in grad school on  cleaning in r as well as a few stats classes.

**applications**

i applied to 8 jobs that were a mix of field scientist and /computational biology roles. all were human which i had no background in. i found these jobs through looking at well known biotech and lab companies i had heard of or used their product in the lab; i applied through their website every time with no cover letter. i chopped down my cv to a one page resume (for good or bad):




*yes, i did all three degrees at one school and also had a weird crisis where i thought i wanted to go into policy....*

**application timeline for eventual position**

* day 0: applied (all 8 jobs on one friday night)
* day 6: contacted for hr interview
* day 9: phone screen with hr
* day13/14 technical interview (gave me a weekend)
* day 20: okayed from technical, hm scheduled
* day 25: 30 min hiring manager
* day 30: panel (presented analysis i did in technical)
* day 31: verbal
* day 32: official offer
* day 58: start day

5/8 jobs contacted me (3 ghosts) with me declining to move forward 3 times, 1 i did not move forward with after i got my role, and 1 rejected after the hr screen.

i used sratoolkit to download the sra files and dump the fastq files on my drive. i concatenated them, trimmed them with trim-galore and aligned them using hisat2. subsequently, i did the usual conversion to bam, ran samtools fixmate and sorted them before removing duplicates with samtools markdup. finally, i ran featurecounts on them before collating them into a four-columned frame and running them on deseq2.

bioinformatics,"so, i did look at the faq and couldn't quite find an answer to this.   


background:

i got my ba in biology back in 2019 and just graduated with my master's in bio this past may (2022). i originally had the idea to teach in the community college setting and was working as a lab manager at a local community college until a year ago when i realized teaching was not for me.   
now i work as a customer support at a small education simulation company. 

i realized this past year how much i enjoy working in  analytics, and  or computational biology seem like a good use of my formal education as well as what i actually like to do.

question:

what do i do to be a marketable candidate for  analytics or  type roles? 

since i have both a ba and ms in bio, i feel like i have the educational background in the biology side of this, but i have no formal education in any sort of coding languages except a little bit in r during my undergrad. 

my search has taken me to places like coursera where i see a lot of certificates that i could potentially work on to show a more formal education in the informatics side of this career. 

if you saw my resume with the ba and ms in just biology and only a a coursera certificate or two, would i really be marketable? 

i want to make sure i'm pursuing a course of action that is most efficient (i.e. if the ""ibm   professional certificate"" on coursera doesn't do squat to help me find a job in the field, i'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere).

bioinformatics,"hi all, i have been doing some microbiome work, and the most tedious part of my analysis is consolidating all individual samples from a single treatment together. i’m having trouble finding the words to google what sort of package i need to find. for example, if i have results from 20 treatment samples from 20 different sampling dates, i run my analysis pipeline on each individual sample and then it’s annoying to consolidate all samples belonging to one treatment in excel because not all sample dates have the same bacteria community. there are overlapping species but also some unique species in each sample. essentially i need one set for all treatment samples with the bacteria listed and the relative abundance of that bacteria.

so essentially i need to:
1. combine multiple samples from one treatment that have overlapping but also unique bacterial species within them, into one set
2. add in 0s for all  values where a bacteria did not appear for that sample date

hopefully that made sense. if it helps, the column names i get from each individual sample analysis have columns bacteria, and abundance. for the final consolidated set columns would be date, treatment, bacteria, abundance.

2) intel xeon w-2275 (14 core, 28 thread,  3.3-4.6ghz, ok cache).

use case is primarily multi-omics analysis at both single cell and bulk levels.

so what are your thoughts? i’ll be starting my honours year around june next year but i’ll be applying in like april. do you think i would be useless? i do have a bit of experience in  as some of my subjects have the occasional bioinformatic related assignment. what can i do to increase my chances of getting in?undergrad in genetics and microbiology into ?"

for the typical seurat workflow there are steps to first lognormalize cell counts (dividing count of each gene by total count in cell) and then center (subtract avg count from each feature across cells) and scale (divide each count by stdev of the count of that feature across cells). cumulatively scaling and centering seems to transform the counts to zscores. 

i'm trying to understand what the purpose and rationale for these steps are so i'm not doing them blindly. 

for the lognormalization, i suppose it makes sense to normalize counts to more adequately compare abundance across cells. but i'm curious why we need to convert counts to zscores. is there some practical reason, for example by helping downstream clustering? thanks everyone :)","in single cell  analysis, why is it important to lognormalize, scale, and center gene counts?",1,97,763,16,"hi everyone,

so the screenshot shows many reads aligning to calr and with good coverage. but when i check the seurat object, there is only one cell that detects 1 umi.   
i generated plots from a downstream analysis of the seurat object that shows the same discrepancy but here i will show the raw set to simplify it and show that filtering is not occurring.

    calr_umi_counts_pb &lt;- cbind(calr_umi_counts_pb, rownames(calr_umi_counts_pb))
    

this code outputs a frame of umi counts across cell barcodes for one gene. i added another column based off the rownames to be able to search for barcodes.   


[resulting table based on descending order of umi counts. ](
this shows only one cell detects one umi for calr which is very different than what igv is showing. and this set was generated just by loading in the files necessary to create a seurat object. so no downstream filtering has occurred.  
next i looked to see if maybe the cells being visualized in igv weren’t in the seurat object so i randomly selected one read which is why i highlighted the cell barcode in my first screenshot which was cattctatgcctacgg. 

the same sample had been sequenced through 10x because the original question was an interest in comparing transcript coverage. so they share the same cell barcodes but the pb  has to have its barcodes reverse complemented (i believe because of how it's being sequenced in the zmw but i could be wrong). so reverse transcribing the cell barcode i highlighted, you get ccgtaggcatagaatg. 

when i search the pb grame for that cell barcode, it is present but no umis are detected. even though that same cell had displayed a read in igv. 

[looking at a specific cell barcode with 0 umi count even though the igv displayed a read ](
is there something about igv i am grossly misunderstanding? i don't think there is anything wrong with my r script but maybe thats also an issue? i recreated the bam file following pacbio’s pipeline and got the same bam file as their platform has given so i’m very lost here. i would appreciate any strategy or direction

both labs are fairly similar on their face; they both develop tools for analyzing microbial dna sequences. both are 100% dry lab. i get along extremely well with both of the advisors and i enjoyed both of my rotations immensely. i'll term them lab a and lab b.

lab a develops tools for transposon analysis. it's the new/hip/modern ""where the field is going"" lab, as the advisors of both lab a and lab b have told me. it's ""pipeline-oriented"", makes use of environment management tools like conda, and its publications focus on both the tools themselves and the actual conclusions that can be drawn from them, so they publish in both  and genetics journals. although the lab itself is a 100% dry lab, they do have collaborations and co-publications with wet labs. i would be working primarily on  analysis using an existing program the lab has developed; the pi wants to bring on another student to keep developing it, but has essentially said that he wants someone with a computer  background, so it wouldn't be me.

lab b is the lab of a very senior professor, who isn't taking on students anymore but has agreed to make an exception for me (he taught one of my intro classes and we talked a lot outside of class as i'm a trans dude and he has a trans son that's my age). in this lab, i would have my own project, started from scratch, writing a program to process some kind of dna  and get some kind of output (either my rotation project, or if that doesn't go anywhere, a new project we would come up with). the pi is very oriented toward low-level programming languages and algorithm development, which i don't have much past experience with but i think would be very interesting. he's intonated that this part of the field is more competitive, though.

importantly, lab b doesn't have any funding. however, he's arranged for the department to fund me for spring (the department has a lot more money than students interested in the program, as admission is through a general-biology admission program, and some years, like this one, only a couple students join the binf department). after that i would be taing the graduate-level binf classes i taken for the remainder of my phd (my school doesn't have an undergraduate binf program). lab a doesn't have guaranteed funding, so i may or may not have to ta, but the pi is still actively applying for grants, so it's likely that i wouldn't have to ta every semester and may not have to ta at all.

i could see myself enjoying both labs for sure, and i'm not sure which one would be better to join. my partner works in computer  and has suggested that ""efficient programming"" --ie the algorithm development/low level efficient stuff -- may not actually be very important in career prospects (""if your program takes more storage space than it needs to, the company will just buy more hard drives""), but that it's a harder skill to pick up so if i want to learn it, doing it now is a good idea. i am quite interested in it but i'm concerned that competitiveness/oversaturation in that field may be an obstacle both to publication and to eventually getting a job in that area. i guess my questions are:

1) is one group of skills more useful than another or more important to get ""early on"" in my career?

2) how are the prospects in each sub-field? is algorithm development too saturated?

bioinformatics,"i'm interested in implementing a metatranscriptomics pipeline. i see a variety of options, but i'm struggling to determine an approach that is best suited to my needs. 

my highest priorities at present are using a de novo, rna-seq specific (splice-aware) assembler. i will need to parse the assembly using alignment methods to identify reads of interest.

per the paper linked below, i have found 3 possibilities - squeezemeta, mosca, and imp (i'm not interested in using humann for several reasons).

[**
squeezemeta and mosca both use metagenomic de novo assemblers, which is my main reservation in attempting to use them. using metagenomic assemblers for rna-seq  is not a validated approach, to my knowledge. imp requires a corresponding metagenome, which i do not have for these samples.

the paper also demonstrates that trinity has been shown to be at least somewhat effective for de novo metatranscriptome assembly, despite being designed for single-organism assembly. several biostars posts also suggest that trinity is a good option for this.

so, here's what i'm thinking i'll try.

1. filter human reads using star
2. trim and assemble the remaining reads using trinity
3. use the assembly to generate a gff and amino acid fasta using prodigal
4. use other tools to identify reads of interest using the protein fasta (blast, etc)
5. align reads using the gff and star (or maybe hisat2)
6. quantify reads of interest using salmon (or stringtie)

bioinformatics,"the key idea is to take advantage of the stochastic nature of diffusion to generate a probability distribution that is used to determine the location of the mutation. in particular, the model is designed to have a very high probability of occurring in a region of interest (roi), but a low probability of occuring in other regions that are not of interest. this is in contrast to the more commonly used monte carlo method, which attempts to assign a probability to every point in the model space.



there are a number of issues to be dealt with when trying to implement this in software. first, one has to be careful not to overfit the model to the . this can be done by using a bayesian estimator of the likelihood of the model, as is done in the paper cited above. another issue is that, as mentioned above, the model has to be able to deal with non-gaussian distributions. a solution to this is to use a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) algorithm for the generation of the distribution. this is an iterative algorithm that allows one to iteratively improve the model as one goes through the process of mutation and diffusion. however, it is computationally expensive, and requires a lot of memory to store the state of the model at each iteration.



in my work, i’ve been looking at ways to speed up the mcmc algorithm. one of the things that i’ve come up with is to use a technique known as backpropagation. this is a well-studied technique for learning to solve problems that are hard to solve by hand. for example, it is used in machine learning to find patterns in  that are hidden from the user. the idea is that the  is divided into blocks, and each block is trained on a subset of the . after training, the blocks are recombined to form a model that generalizes to the rest of the . this technique is very powerful, and can be used to train models that are much more complex than those that can be trained by hand.



backpropagation works by applying a gradient descent algorithm to the model. gradient descent is a fairly simple algorithm, but one that is difficult to get right. it is easy to fall into what is known as the levenshtein-fokker-planck (lfp) trap, where the gradient descends too quickly, and ends up converging to a value that is too close to the value that you want to converge to. to avoid this, one has to make sure that the gradient is slow enough to give time for the algorithm to converge to the right value. this is a problem that has been tackled by a number of researchers, most notably john resig \[4\]. he has found a way to do this by adding a delay to the gradient descent algorithm. this delay is based on the length of the block of  that is being trained. if the block is small, there is little need for a delay, and the algorithm can be run quickly. on the other hand, if the block is large, it is better to wait a little longer before running the algorithm, so that the algorithm has more time to converge to the right value.



i thought that this might be a good idea for a model that is going to be used to solve problems that are hard to solve by hand. so i wrote a program that implements the algorithm, and tested it on a number of problems. here are the results:



the performance is good, and i was able to get it to converge to the right value in less than 10,000 iterations. this is a lot faster than the time it would take to run the algorithm by hand, and it is comparable to the performance of the lfp algorithm that resig used in his paper.



one of the problems that i ran into was that the algorithm didn’t seem to work very well on images that had noise in them. this is because the noise is spread across the image, and it is difficult to tell where the noise is coming from. i ended up having to do some work to make things work, but it was worth it to get the algorithm to work as well as it did.",thoughts on using diffusors for bio?,1,36,3960,6,"the key idea is to take advantage of the stochastic nature of diffusion to generate a probability distribution that is used to determine the location of the mutation. in particular, the model is designed to have a very high probability of occurring in a region of interest (roi), but a low probability of occuring in other regions that are not of interest. this is in contrast to the more commonly used monte carlo method, which attempts to assign a probability to every point in the model space.

bioinformatics,"i'm about 16 months into my postdoc, and am coming to the swift and startling realization that the tenure track is not for me. the thought of scraping by on mid five-figure salaries for the next 3-5 (or more) years with minimal benefits and poor work/life balance only to \*maybe\* get a pi position that would bring with it the additional stress of securing grants just to get by makes me want to vomit. plus, i am becoming increasingly more angry at being a cog in the academic machine that values postdocs not as doctorate-level thinkers but as a nearly free source of undervalued labor.

so now i'm looking around at my 55k/year postdoc salary while still feeling like i'm being treated much like a grad student and wondering what i am still doing here.

i have a strong wet-lab background, but am truly  passionate about computational . i am in no means a computer programer, but i have a very solid understanding of molecular biology, which gives me a leg-up when it comes to  analysis and understanding experimental methods/design. i have experience with python, r, and linux shell scripting, and have done a tone of transcriptomics analysis and 16s amplicon community analysis for microbiome projects. i don't have any ml experience, but that's something i'd be very excited about getting into.

since i am straying away from the pi track and my current lab isn't providing me much advanced training/mentorship, i gotten in the rut of feeling like i'm just an underpaid lab tech, which is not why i got my phd. i shouldn't feel this way....i don't work much more than 40 hours a week and am decently productive publication wise, but i just feel so blah going into work every day. it would be so nice to be excited about my role again and feel valued for my skills and contributions (both monetarily and within the lab!). 

the must-haves on my future job list are: 

* remote/hybrid work (i do not want to relocate but would travel every other month or so for meetings and such)
* make a decent amount of money for my education level (100k+ would be ideal)

* decent vacation/benefits and generally good work/life balance (right now i get 10 total vacation days....so anything over that would be great).

so far, i considered going into industry (i been casually submitting industry job applications, but the biotech market is a tough place right now with a lot of layoffs), finding a staff scientist position at my current university, or a jumping ship from  and being a  writer. i have 3 publications i'm wrapping up in the next couple of months that i really want to complete before i would leave, but i am fairly miserable on a daily basis with my current position.

i'm wondering if anyone have any similar experiences, and/or any advice for me at this stage? i think i just also needed to vent a bit....being a postdoc is much more mentally taxing that i expected, and i feel like i'm constantly being gaslighted  by academia into thinking i should be grateful for my stipend and the handouts (like healthcare) that i do receive.

so now i'm looking around at my 55k/year postdoc salary while still feeling like i'm being treated much like a grad student and wondering what i am still doing here.

i have a strong wet-lab background, but am truly  passionate about computational . i am in no means a computer programer, but i have a very solid understanding of molecular biology, which gives me a leg-up when it comes to  analysis and understanding experimental methods/design. i have experience with python, r, and linux shell scripting, and have done a tone of transcriptomics analysis and 16s amplicon community analysis for microbiome projects. i don't have any ml experience, but that's something i'd be very excited about getting into.

since i am straying away from the pi track and my current lab isn't providing me much advanced training/mentorship, i gotten in the rut of feeling like i'm just an underpaid lab tech, which is not why i got my phd. i shouldn't feel this way....i don't work much more than 40 hours a week and am decently productive publication wise, but i just feel so blah going into work every day. it would be so nice to be excited about my role again and feel valued for my skills and contributions (both monetarily and within the lab!). 

the must-haves on my future job list are: 

* remote/hybrid work (i do not want to relocate but would travel every other month or so for meetings and such)
* make a decent amount of money for my education level (100k+ would be ideal)
* have a trusting supervisor who values my work and trusts me to get it done on my own schedule (obviously would be available during certain times for meetings and such)

anyway. i am not allowed to do my own  and i need to provide bioit with a tool to perform the procedure that i described above. sure they can use guppy or epi2me, but i would like them to assign the correct taxonomy, as they usually rely on rdp 13.2, which is not accurate for animal and environmental samples. for this reason i would like to have silva, dada2 or gtdb integrated.

i work in a  lab and will be starting my master's soon. when i first started working in the lab as an intern i didn't know anything so i asked a lot of questions (i have no prior experience in ). but many of my colleagues that have been here for a long time didn't know the answers to my questions. as a result, i really had to study everything on my own. 

even with something basic like deg analysis (just using tools like deseq or edger) i always have something i am unsure about and no one can help me. for instance, my  had very different results depending on what type of normalisation i used in edger. i asked my lab members at a progress meeting and no one knew why that would happen.

i feel like everyone just uses tools without knowing what they really do and when something goes a bit wrong, they just go with the methods that give the best results. is this normal? isn't knowing why we use a particular methodology supposed to be important? if i just tried a bunch of methods and went with the result that ""looks good"" is that okay?

the pi is way too busy to deal with the details (my lab has many departments and tons of projects in multiple research areas) so my colleagues and i are the ones that have to be responsible for the most part. the pi told me that when i use a tool or algorithm, i should know it well enough to be able to recreate it and run it myself, but my colleagues definitely don't do that. 

to what extent am i expected to know everything when the people around me don't seem to know? i feel like my pi is quite right, but nobody else seems to study deeply enough to do that. don't get me wrong, my colleagues are all smart and probably way better researchers than i am. we also don't have much time because of the overflowing projects.

bioinformatics,"hi everyone! sorry if this question seems basic. i am trying to run the mageck pipeline to analyze crispr knockout screen  produced by someone in my lab around 5 years ago. i was given the  as bam files and also have the sequencing sample statistics from when the samples were run including the number of total reads, aligned reads, and unaligned reads. i converted the bam files back to fastq files using

samtools view -h -f 2048 filename.bam &gt; tmp.bam

bedtools bamtofastq -i tmp.bam -fq filename.fastq

after converting the bam files back to fastq files, i ran the mageck count function. i saw that none of the total reads matched between the mageck count summary output file and the original sequencing statistics. 

more problematically, a few samples had significantly fewer total reads (like 50,000) shown on the mageck count summary output files relative to the original sequencing statistics (\~44 million). as a result, many of the sgrnas are not represented at all in the sample (there are \~61,000 zero counts relative to the total 77441 sgrnas) which is impacting my analysis.

bioinformatics,"hi all. apologies if this question seems basic. i'm hoping to get information in the differential expression of various intronic regions in bulk rna-seq sets. i previously processed bulk rna-seq  using hisat2/samtools/featurecounts. however, i'm not so sure about whether utilities like hisat2 can be used to align reads to introns (preferably without exons) and retain them for downstream analysis.

briefly, my questions are:

1. does hisat2 also align reads to intronic regions?

2. if this is the case, i was wondering if something like [bedmap](
3. are there any other tools used for this type of analysis?

bioinformatics,"we are sequencing a single gene - gene x - from a population of bacteria. we know the exact sequence of gene x and also that the populations contains two variants - they differ by a single basepair in gene x at position 50 (of the pcr product). we pcr amplified gene x and have sent it for nanopore sequencing.

looking at the fastq file, i noticed that there are a lot of ""mutations"" in the reads - there are mutations even in the region that is the primer sequence used to amplify it - which should ideally be a perfect match (it was synthesized just for the pcr).

how can i trust that a mutation at position 50 of gene x, is actually one of the variants rather than a mis-called base during sequencing?

is it right to compare variances between replicates with variances between conditions? the number of replicates and number of samples are different here.

suppose i have 5 conditions; each with a different number of replicates; i.e. 25, 50, 100, 150, 175.  with a certain expression value. i would like to remove the expression values with a larger variance within the replicates relative to the variance across the 5 conditions. to do that, i find the mean expression value for each condition, before taking only the expression values with a higher variance between the mean expression across conditions than the maximum variance in each condition between replicates. 

is this direct comparison approach correct, or should i have considered some other metric instead?

i would like to make nanopore long reads alignment in r ( it is more convenience in my specific situation). can anyone suggest my the proper way to do it?? i have tried to make it with rsubread an rsamtols in the following manner:

making the genome index, alligent with sublong function, and  sorting the generated bam with sortbam function. 

nevertheless, the output that i have obtained so far is different from using samtools in bash, and the consequent results are not what we wanted.



can anyone tell me if i am doing wrong or if there exist another pipeline to generate this sorted bam??

as far as resume goes, i really only have my degree to my name, which i'm really disappointed in myself for. i studied under a lot of great instructors who are incredibly knowledgeable and have done amazing research in the field, but my grades in their classes weren't amazing and i never felt like i was able to get really close to any of them. actually, i feel like i haven't really much networking at all, and i don't have anything really in terms of research/academic/work/extracurricular experience (unless you count a few r and python workflows from class projects up on github, but it's honestly just some basic stuff).

obviously with all that a ms is basically out of the picture (not that i would have been able to afford it right out of school without scholarships anyways, and i think most ms programs prefer a minimum of 3.0 gpa for applicants anyways, right...?), so i was planning on doing entry-level lab and industry work stuff for around 1-3 years to build up some relevant work experience while maybe doing some non-matriculated courses on the side and then coming back to it later. unfortunately, it seems like almost every job listing seems to want at least a ms to even be considered. i sent out a good handful of applications to some lab technician and  analyst positions for fresh undergrads (0-2 years experience) but they all been ignored. 

~~am i underqualified because of my lack of skills or because the only job openings i can find online are all for lab tech positions at really high-ranking schools? am i unlucky because of the shaky economy? am i doomed forever...?!?

bioinformatics,"hi everyone,

background:

as part of a review on the potential of cellular enlargement as a new ageing factor our group manually went through thousands of abstracts and then hundreds of papers to find papers that reported a correlation between cell size and some aspect of ageing (an actual causal relationship has only been shown in blood stem cells last year).

so now i have a set of around 1300 papers that were hits, and another few thousand that appeared in our search on pubmed but did not report a correlation.

what i would like to do is to use the set to train an ai to do the same thing we did 1. for new studies 2. for other aspects of ageing that we did not look out.

the problem:
some search terms returned a lot more hits than others (makes sense since how much size matters likely varies between biological systems). however, because of this i'm not sure how useful the set is actually in recognising ""things connected with ageing"" (picking up in ""cell size"" is easy since it is mentioned in all the papers)

i have limited experience with machine learning and none outside of some hobbyist fascination with natural language processing algorithms.

any suggestions on how to help an algorithm pick up on such a multifaceted thing such as ageing would be appreciated. also i am unsure whether my set is large enough for such a project.

background:

as part of a review on the potential of cellular enlargement as a new ageing factor our group manually went through thousands of abstracts and then hundreds of papers to find papers that reported a correlation between cell size and some aspect of ageing (an actual causal relationship has only been shown in blood stem cells last year).

so now i have a set of around 1300 papers that were hits, and another few thousand that appeared in our search on pubmed but did not report a correlation.

bioinformatics,"apologies if this is a very basic question, but i am very new to molecular dynamics simulations and i struggle to find resources on this. i am trying to understand how 2-dimensional free energy surfaces function of two collective variables (cv) can be computed (something analog to this [
reading here and there, i understood that g=-kblogp(s), where s is a state. i assume that to plot these surfaces in unbiased molecular dynamics, i would compute the p(cv1, cv2) for every value of cv1 and cv2 observed in my simulation, i.e. just counting how many times a specific combination happens (presumably by histogramming to have some ranges), and normalizing, and then simply apply kblog to each of these probabilities. assuming that this is correct:

\- how specifically the probabilities are calculated, in terms of how the bins of values are defined for the histogram, and so on?

\- why using 2 collective variables, rather than just plotting the potential of mean force with one of them, or using three of them? in other words, why the 2d convention is so much used in the papers, rather than others?

i hope this is not a super-stupid question, and i will greatly appreciate if you could point to me where to find a tutorial for this - as well as some pedagogical material that i can use to educate myself (ideally, something that explains fes calculations in unbiased and biased biomolecular simulations). i find it quite hard to understand specific papers about this.

i'm a aspirant phd student currently involved in the application processes. as today i got rejected for the 4th time (once i was shortlisted and then rejected, the other 3 times i was directly rejected), some question started to come up in my mind.

1. how am i supposed to learn from failed applications?

feedbacks received (after weeks/months of waiting) are usually something like ""your application process ends here"" or ""you have not been shortlisted for the above position, so you are not among the candidates selected for assessment"". now, i'm not expecting eth to give me a detailed explanation on why my application failed, but i find it difficult to understand what went wrong.

2) does being a ""pure"" bioinformatician represent a disadvantage?

most of the phd vacancies under the search term """" or ""computational biology"" regard both dry 

3) how much value do recruiters give to publications?

i feel like candidates with a publication are pretty advantaged. fair enough. however i think, *with due exceptions*, publishing during the bachelor's or master's years is more a matter of being in the right place at the right time rather than being a better phd candidate.  although my cv has some strengths (highest graduation score, some individual projects in the portfolio and period spent on a quite known institute as an intern), i do not currently have a publication.  should i spend some time in a lab to get one and then go back to phd applications?

4) does the motivational letter really matter? do you have any tips on how to write a good one?

i thought this was the most important step. i try to apply some guidelines based on what i find on youtube or blogs. for example i write a specific letter to the institute i am applying for, rather than having a standard motivational letter used multiple times. however, i am afraid that given these multiple rejections, my letters are  something.

i was also curious how so many reads were mapping to a intron of a gene (also seen in the image) if this is supposed to be rna seq. shouldn't introns be spliced out and the reads correspond to genes that have been transcribed?

bioinformatics,"hi everyone, i have a little technical question where i'm not sure how to get to the end result i want.

i have two inputs.
1. some bacterial reference genomes.
2. a collection of 50 something genes that are not homologous, but their proteins work together in a complex. for each gene i have a nucleotide and aa fasta that has it's sequences across the bacterial domain (dereplicated). i also have hmms generated for each gene from these sequences.

now, i have a hypothesis that some of these proteins might be in an operon. what i want to do is to visualise their loci along each genome and eyeball it.

i can use nhmmer with each hmm and then extract each gene's start, end, strand etc alongside the genome. what i'm not sure about is how to combine this information into a format that i can plug into an existing genome visualiser like artemis or igv so that i can eyeball it. 

questions i got so far:
1. what file formats should i look into generating? would a bed file work?

bioinformatics,"hello guys, hope you all are doing well. we have the opportunity to upgrade our server infrastructure.  will be used predominantly for ngs (exome + genome)  (no ml yet, but would like to keep options open).

there is no fixed budget to work with - generally the lower the better. for the sake of post, lets consider 10 lakh inr (\~12k usd) as the maximum budget.

usage - there are 3 bioinformaticians who use the servers, mainly for processing research wes/wgs , but also running analysis using different tools (for ex. to detect cnvs, kinship analysis, etc). we have hosted a http server and a streamlit app where our lab mates (\~15 individuals) can access files and . the server is running on rhel7, main tools we use include bwa-mem2, gatk suite, annovar, etc.

we are currently using a server with the following specification -

&gt;dell 2u server (bought in 2016)  
&gt;  
&gt;intel xeon e5-2660 v4 x 2, 12 cores, 24 threads, totalling to 56 threads  
&gt;  
&gt;ram - 378 gb  
&gt;  
&gt;storage - 72tb mounted in 2 equal sized partitions, raid 5 (6tb hdd x 13)  
&gt;  
&gt;gigabit networking

we have roughly 5 tb storage remaining. we have \~3000 exome samples , \~40 wgs samples (all the samples have bams + fastq.gz files) and a bunch of softwares and resources. we try to remove intermediate files as soon as possible, but the server tends to be in use most of the time. we use onedrive to backup the gvcf files (university email comes with 1 tb onedrive storage, but this is just a spot fix) but bam files aren't backed up any where. we plan to delete older , ex. any  3 or more years old. however, even such files are accessed occasionally when doing analysis.

my ideas are as follows - 

1. use a nas to store archived bam and fastq files
2. if possible, upgrade server

there is a nas model from dell which might be suitable for our purpose, but quoted for 4 lakhs inr with decked out storage (12tb x 4).

so instead of just upgrading our storage, i'm thinking of retiring old server for storage + some experimental stuff and buying a new server instead.



the configuration i decided is as follows -

* poweredge 750xs 
* intel silver 4314 (16c, 32t) x 2
* 256 gb ram (which is eye wateringly expensive!)
* 1.2 tb hdd for os, as just a 480 gb ssd was quited for \~600usd)

there is no fixed budget to work with - generally the lower the better. for the sake of post, lets consider 10 lakh inr (\~12k usd) as the maximum budget.

usage - there are 3 bioinformaticians who use the servers, mainly for processing research wes/wgs , but also running analysis using different tools (for ex. to detect cnvs, kinship analysis, etc). we have hosted a http server and a streamlit app where our lab mates (\~15 individuals) can access files and . the server is running on rhel7, main tools we use include bwa-mem2, gatk suite, annovar, etc.

we are currently using a server with the following specification -

&gt;dell 2u server (bought in 2016)  
&gt;  
&gt;intel xeon e5-2660 v4 x 2, 12 cores, 24 threads, totalling to 56 threads

&gt;  
&gt;storage - 72tb mounted in 2 equal sized partitions, raid 5 (6tb hdd x 13)  
&gt;  
&gt;gigabit networking

we have roughly 5 tb storage remaining. we have \~3000 exome samples , \~40 wgs samples (all the samples have bams + fastq.gz files) and a bunch of softwares and resources. we try to remove intermediate files as soon as possible, but the server tends to be in use most of the time. we use onedrive to backup the gvcf files (university email comes with 1 tb onedrive storage, but this is just a spot fix) but bam files aren't backed up any where. we plan to delete older , ex. any  3 or more years old. however, even such files are accessed occasionally when doing analysis.

bioinformatics,"hey  community!

i am applying for cs / computational biology phd programs in the us this year (mostly coming from the cs and machine learning side), and i have a few doubts/confusion about whether my profile is competitive enough:

strong points:

1. i have a master's degree from a prestigious and well-known university.
2. i have published research papers, and more are on the way, although they won't be published before the admission process is over.
3. i have worked under a professor who is well-known in the field, and he knows me well.

weak points:

1. i don't have a research paper as a first author.
2. i don't have a third lor from a professor, only from a professional one. i tried to get some positions this year by emailing professors from other universities but did not get a response.
3. i don't have a 4+ gpa (just slightly less).
4. my major is in computer , although i did take many computational biology courses, as well as cs courses like ml and nlp that are going to be relevant in computational biology

lor:

1. from the professor who is well-known in the field
2. from another professor with whom i published a paper - although he is pretty blunt as to who he will give his ""top"" referral letter every year, and i am sure it's not going to be me.
3. from my manager at an internship as i mentioned before.

3. stanford phd cs (with a focus on comp bio)
4. some other top cs programs which have computational biology as a subfocus.

bioinformatics,"hello everybody,

it's me again, bothering with another cnas/cancer question.

i started working with cancer , in particular with cnas. unfortunately, i do not have a strong biological background, and basically none in cancer. so, even after reading all the related answers i could find and more related papers, it is still have many doubts.i will try to list them for the sake of a clear exposition:

1. **how is the cn defined?** i'll try to explain. when detecting cnvs using read depth, what is usually done is mapping back the reads and then try to identify regions with higher/lower coverage then others. so, for e.g., in the case of a normal diploid genome, if i had a copy of a region only in one chromosome, by mapping back all my reads to the reference, i would expect to find that one region has double the normalized coverage of the others, so detecting that there is **1** more copy of that particular region with respect to a reference. in the case of a tetraploid sample, i would expect that if a region is duplicated in a single cromosome, i would still detect an absolute gain of **1** for that region. is this correct?
2. **what are the relative and absolute copy numbers?** i found these different answers on the web, so i couldn't figure out. taking into account the previous example, i.e. having a gain of **1** copy of a segment, would this be a *relative* cn? and if i knew the ploidy, how would i use it to find the *absolute* cn?
3. in my case, i would need to **compare the results** from multiple tools. would it still make sense to eventually compare the *relative* cn, if i do not know the tumor ploidy?

since the hcc1395 cell line was already studied before, i found some other studies providing the cnas they found for it. my question now is: can i use those cnas found in other studies on the same cell line as a ground truth to compare what i will find with our tool on the  i have?

i don't have much biological knowledge and my doubts arise manly because, if i undersood well, those cells are usually grown independently in a laboratory setting for each study, so i am not sure if they are comparable, or if they could have different mutations occurring between the different studies.

bioinformatics,"hey guys! i used snippy tool to align genome of bacteria samples to see if they belong in the same cluster or transmission pattern. 

according to snippy documentation, it says 

a “core site” is a genomic position that is present in all the samples. a core site can have the same nucleotide in every sample (“monomorphic”) or some samples can be different (“polymorphic” or ""variant""). if we ignore the complications of ""ins"", ""del"" variant types, and just use variant sites, these are the ""core snp genome"".

bioinformatics,"i don't see many compilations of technical tips and advice for people doing graduate degrees in this field and fields like it (maybe because i'm not looking in the right places) but i thought i'd share some things i learned during the degree i'm currently finishing because someone else might find them useful.  knowing these things would have probably saved me weeks in work time.  


**separate your  processing,  analysis and visualization scripts:**  
in my view the three major components of much of  and   in general is a. getting and processing your , b. running your analyses and c. creating plots and graphs of your  and analyses. since you might want to tweak each one independently (for me getting the plots just right was a sisyphean nightmare, i work in python) you should be able to do each of those things separately by generating all the files you need as an output from the previous part and use them in the entry point of the next part. this way you don't need to execute your entire pipeline each time just to see if the font size change you just made to figure 7 looks better. this may sound obvious, but not necessarily to someone who never did this before.  


**don't wait too long to ask for help:**  
you will inevitably get to a point where you need it. it is good to try to solve things yourself for the learning experience, but you also shouldn't let certain problems take too much of your time since there are many other things to do and learn and not too much time, especially in a masters degree. this refers to both asking your pi/colleagues for help but also other people. don't be afraid to reach out to the authors of a paper (after running it by your pi if you don't already have his full confidence) and ask questions. the corresponding author will most likely refer you to the first author who will usually be happy to talk about the paper.   


**don't try to generalize your code in advance unless you have too much time on your hands:**  
you may be tempted to make some methods or plotting functions more general than you need for the specific analysis you are currently doing, anticipating that in the future you will want to generalize (plot the analysis of an arbitrary number of sets instead of just the one you are doing right now, have the option to change some of your model's parameters in the function call, etc.) but in my experience this is kind of a waste of time, on average. unless your are sure that you will be using it (like if you are actually going to do it immediately after trying the simpler case) then it is safe enough to postpone writing more complicated code. you may be surprised at how often plans change and most of the time you will be trying out new things, rather than enhancing older analyses (that part usually only comes later).  


**never, ever measure yourself against what others are doing:**  
there will be many other students with strong backgrounds in the things you wish you knew better, doing things that look incredible and make it look easy doing it. there will also be many students who will be struggling more than you. it is important to remember that everyone has different backgrounds, different opportunities, and different natural abilities. we may have different viewpoints on this but in my opinion everything is pretty much up to chance: you don't get to choose what interests you, how fast you learn, what projects you get (at first), how much motivation you will have 1 - 1.5 years into your degree (or even how likely you are as a person to overcome periods of poor mental health and low motivation - even managing to push through these hard times is an ability that some have and some don't). even if you don't like the results you get or feel bad about your effort and motivation because others seem to be doing better, and even if the degree doesn't work out for you in the end,  you should feel pride in your hard work and the work you are doing to  push through because if you care enough to feel bad about it then you are probably already doing what you can. take things one day at a time and remember everyone turns out ok in the end.  


documenting your thoughts and things you tried: i know a lot of people recommend keeping track of what they do with a log or work manager, but i found it to be kind of hit or miss: all of my work was documented by definition anyway as code, and for me simply having a list of things i'm supposed to be doing in the next couple of weeks to cross off as i do them was sufficient - anything more felt like a bit of a time waste with micromanaging myself.

bioinformatics,"hi, so i am (interestingly) not in , but do have to run a large embarrassingly parallel program of monte-carlo simulations on a hpc. i was pointed to  by hpc and snakemake/nextflow for scheduling tasks via slurm and later taking it to google cloud or aws if i want.

i am running a bunch of neural networks in pytorch/jax in parallel and since this will (hopefully) be eventually published, i want to ensure it is as reproducible as possible. right now, my environment is dockerized, which i have translated to a singularity environment. the scripts themselves are in python.



here's my question right now, i need to run a set of models completely in parallel, just with different seeds/frozen stochastic realizations. these are trained off of simulations from a model that will also be run completely in parallel within the training loop.

eventually, down the road, after each training step i will need to sum a computed value in each training step and after running it through a simple function, pass the result back to all agents as part of the  they will learn from. so it is no longer quite embarrassingly parallel, but still highly parallel beyond that aggregation step.



what is the best way to do this efficiently? should i be looking at snakemake/nextflow and writing/reading from files, passing these objects back and forth? should i be looking at something more general like ploomber? should i be doing everything within python via pytorch's torch.distributed library or dask? i have no prior investment in any of the above technologies, so it would be whichever would be best starting from scratch.

i am running deseq2 on my , but i am not sure what design model should i feed deseq2.

my project has 4 variables: age, sex, genotype, treatment. we are mostly interested in the interactions between genotype and treatment during adulthood, but we have some untreated  at young time. sex is just a covariate and we are not interested in it.

- young  
  - untreated  
    - wt 
- old  
  - untreated  
    - wt 
  - treated  
    - wt 

following deseq2's vignette, i tried creating a variable ""modelvar"" = paste0(age,""_"",genotype,""_"",treatment). i have also tried several approaches:

- use all samples together
   - design = ~ modelvar
      - coefficient = old_wt_treated_vs_old_wt_untreated
          - upregulated deg: 27  
          - downregulated deg: 71

- use all samples together
   - design = ~ modelvar **+ sex**
      - coefficient = old_wt_treated_vs_old_wt_untreated
          - upregulated deg: 42 
          - downregulated deg: 84

[some comments in previous similar threads suggested](
- use **only adult wt samples** (subset the matrix and meta when building the deseq2 object)
   - design = **~ treatment**
      - coefficient = treated_vs_untreated
          - upregulated deg: 75 
          - downregulated deg: 134

- use only adult wt samples (subset the matrix and meta when building the deseq2 object)
   - design = ~ treatment **+ sex**
      - coefficient = treated_vs_untreated
          - upregulated deg: 97 
          - downregulated deg: 178

which model/approach should i use? which design, and which  filtering?

we are mostly interested on seeing:
- effect of genotype (wt vs mut) in young  
- effect of age in genotype (untreated) (young_wt vs old_wt,  young_mut vs old_mut). maybe here i should do a age:genotype?  
- effect of treatment in adult genotype (adult_wt_untreated vs adult_wt_treated, adult_mut_untreated vs adult_mut_treated). maybe here another interaction genotype:treatment ?

i'm not 100% sold on using interaction terms. although on principle they might look good, will they be easily interpretable? 
creating a model with ""design = ~treatment+genotype+treatment:genotype+sex"" gives me the following results:
&gt; resultsnames(ddsm) 
[1] ""intercept""     ""treatment_treated_vs_untreated"" ""genotype_mut_vs_wt"" ""sex_f_vs_m""    ""treatmenttreated.genotypemut""

- ""treatment_treated_vs_untreated"": effect of treated on wt samples  
- ""genotype_mut_vs_wt"": effect of genotype on untreated samples  
- ""sex_f_vs_m"": effect of sex on untreated wt samples?
- ""treatmenttreated.genotypemut"": effect of treated on mut samples?

overfitting is a condition where the model learns way too much. so the question arises ‘will the overfitting impact negatively the model?’ the answer is yes. when the model has learned way too much, it means that model learns noise as well in sets. it means that the model will perform well on seen(train ), but not on unseen (test ). the following steps can be performed to reduce overfitting.

1. clean : before proceeding with building a machine learning model, it is important to clean the . if the set contains any duplicate features or unnecessary features which are not relevant to the use case, then the model tends to overfit as there is a possibility that the noise will also be learned. hence, checking for features and having and reducing dimensionality is important in case of similar features or irrelevant features.
2. perform cross-validation:  cross-validation is another technique in machine learning that provides the method to solve the overfitting condition. just like ensemble learning, cross-validation also divides the set, but the working is different. in cross-validation, training  is made split into several other train-test splits. these splits help in reducing errors in the model
3. regularization: regularization is a technique used to reduce errors by fitting the function appropriately on the given training set and avoiding overfitting.   
it is a form of regression that shrinks the coefficient estimates toward zero. in other words, this technique forces us not to learn a more complex or flexible model, to avoid the problem of overfitting.

 4. ensemble techniques: ensemble models are models consisting of multiple models or algorithms. individual models can be combined through various methods such as bagging, boosting, and stacking. ensemble modeling can reduce variance, minimize modeling method bias and thus decrease chances of overfitting",ways to avoid overfitting in machine learning:,0,46,1938,7,"

datascience,"i have a company problem to generate demand forecast. 
so i used historical  and used sarima (to account for seasonality) and neural prophet to generate forecast and averaged both models prediction, it gave close to real value.

but, another requirement was given to add pre-booking to the model. since pre-booking is a future variable, i used it as future covariate model (exog).

another issue, was  that pre-booking is usually not present that far into the future (2 week) and to generate 2 week forecast , the pre-booking should be known.

to tackle, this problem i used a cascade model.

model 1 - using pre-booking historical  , i first generated pre-booking forecast 2 weeks into the future.

model 2 - the generated pre-booking forecast by model 1 was used as covariate to generate true demand prediction.

also, in both model i'm using features - day of the week, weekend or not.

the final demand prediction varies and i feel it's too messy. is there an alternative method or is my netgid correct?

what all can be improved? any suggestions are welcome.",need help regarding demand forecast.,0,36,1071,5,"i have a company problem to generate demand forecast.

datascience,"hi! i am a student and have been very interested in the ways the bias can be removed from ml sets, and i have some ideas of how bias could hypothetically be reduced but am by no means an expert. i would greatly appreciate any feedback, recommendations, or additions to some of the ideas that i currently have. 

right now, it seems that there is no specific way to completely remove bias from ml sets, but i have been attempting to create a hypothetical design or a process to prevent bias as much as possible.

first off, the quality of the raw  is really the most important part of machine learning sets, but collecting good  is more of a statistical problem. based on what the learning model is trying to do, you would need to consult with statisticians on determining the quality of the  and if it is even valid, and if you should be generating a random sample, or using all raw . as far as the learning model itself, i have formulated a few suggestions for the set itself:

* one of the first ideas that came to mind is excluding 'sensitive' demographic , like age, sex, race, etc, which may work in some instances, but could also backfire.
   * for example, one way of reducing bias is to use the demographics to pre-filter the  and ensure groups are accurately represented.
   * one thing you can do is create two sets and run them through a machine learning model, one with the demographics, and one without, and then compare the results, audit for bias, and see if there is anything you can improve.

* i also found that it must be necessary for there to be input and opinions on the set given by multiple professionals of different backgrounds to prevent any bias from the creator.
* most importantly, there must always be frequent checkups to monitor if any bias has arisen and if so, ways that it can be removed.

datascience,"**tl;dr: want to switch to swe because i enjoy programming more and feel unhappy with my  career experiences. are my reasons valid?** 

hi all,

i been working as a  professional for about 4.5 years now and have been thinking about making the pivot to swe for over a year, just have been spending my time learning more + building my portfolio. the reason is that i find myself enjoying writing code to automate things and create apps more than i really do linear regressions and analyses really. i also took some udemy courses a while ago and really loved learning general python programming more so than i did a python for ml course.

i also been feeling jaded by my work experiences too, which is also partly why i want to switch. i feel like the problem's i been facing is that i end up doing a variety of random tasks because people hire a  person without really understanding what that expertise means or have unrealistic expectations from. i have done what i can to *bring* ideas and improve workflows to each place i worked, but there are limits to how creative i can get depending on the organization. in my last job, i was in a  team with a lot of people who shared a similar background as me (masters or doctorate degrees in epidemiology or biostatistics)-these were very talented people, no doubt, but did not really have a formal programming background or   knowledge outside of methods used in academia. i got asked to do a reporting task at my old job which was an insanely chaotic process done manually for years  by previous analysts (copying and pasting  cleaned into sas into excel templates) with really terrible documentation practices. i taught myself enough r to fully automate this task-something that took more than 40+ hours a week, into zero hours. i also used tools like rmarkdown to create very professional looking documentation with explanations and code. 

when i tried to teach this to my colleagues so i won't be the only person doing this, it was going over their heads. i tried to use visual diagrams (flowcharts) and wrote every tiny detail in the documentation, which was unlike the minimalist documentation i received when i was given this task as a new employee. it still was not clicking. my colleagues admitted they don't like too much programming as a part of their job. i stayed on as a consultant for my team because these reports were considered critical and i would rather be paid than answer questions for my team for free. in retrospect, i regret this because the dependency on me prolonged longer than i expected. there was a new director of the  team who got hired and i showed her all the documents and told her i'm planning to end my consultancy now that she's hired. she told me a few days later she'd like to ""offer me an opportunity to extend my contract"" (?) to ""honor my work"". i told her i really don't want to stay on any longer and would like this work to be taken over. when i trained her on this stuff, i realized she had never used r, sql or even knew excel pivot tables. i don't mean to sound mean or pretentious about my skills because i too was somebody who didn't know this stuff at one time, but i also found it unbelievably unfair and felt a director should have at least some knowledge or ability to take over this work. i felt like my boss who hired people (not a  person) just didn't know the right skills required for the job.

## definition of real-time periods

•	the moment in time when information is released.
•	not arbitrary.  with respect to a given series, not every day in history is a vintage date.  only the dates when new information is released are vintage dates.
•	mark a moment in history when an event occurred and as such are immutable historical facts.

this morning (sunday) my boss messaged me that remote working is only for full-time employees and because of the fact that i'm doing research work, he wants me to work at the office at all times. 

for me, this does feel off, almost like a red flag. to me, there is absolutely no added value in coming to the office: no one ever asks me for help, the office is noisy and often people take up calls in the room next to my desk so i'm getting distracted a lot. the only reason i come to the office once a week is to have meetings and to talk to my coworkers. but, as i posted in this subreddit before, my boss is quite sexist and because i'm the only queer person in the office, a lot of jokes are made about minorities like myself and i really don't like that. i already talked about this with my boss three times, but it's not changing. i feel like i'm not really one of them.

travelling to work costs me 2,5 hours extra per day, which i do not get paid for. when i get home from the office, i'm often tired and then i have to work at uni stuff in the evening. 

the upside of this work is that i learn a lot about ai/ds and that a new, female ai intern will start working in a few weeks whom i really like and i think i could learn a lot from here.

i struggled finding good advice for my situation since it's very unique, so i figured i'd ask a large sample of people potentially in the field. 

i currently hold a finance bachelors (graduated at age 21), for which i completed undergraduate research analyzing the effectiveness of a trump-era policy. (let me know if you're interested and i'll be happy to fill you in on the results.) further, i have an associates in mathematics, which was really just an affordable way for me to add calc i-iii, differential equations, and linear algebra to my resume. further further, i been programming as a hobby since i was 15 (now 23) and i become pretty proficient with python and matlab.

i worked in the commercial real estate business for about a year before realizing i care about money far less than i had originally thought. i had always been interested in engineering, and worried i would seriously regret not pursuing it, so i'm now a civil engineer focused on stormwater and drainage. i know that sounds odd but believe me it's true, i was blessed to have people in my network who truly believed in me, and i done very well at the job. also as an aside, i done python for this company in arcgis to make scripts to automate their workflows. i say that because it's a good resume point.

anyway, although i feel civil engineering is closer to what i want to do, i recognize that i'm already quite bored with it. this is a common theme of mine because i learn very quickly and once i feel i learned the ins and outs of a career progression, i get bored with it. this is why i'm looking towards  /ai research. i want something with a high skill ceiling, and something that gives me a lot of new things to learn and discover.

my questions are as follows:

1. how accurate is my assessment that  /ai research is a high skill ceiling position? if i'm correct, which one (from reading my brief summary) do you think would be a better fit?
2. while i certainly have no domain ""expertise"" per se, i feel i bring a good deal of experience in the finance (and engineering) business to the table. my lack of on the job ds experience and cs degree earmarks me as someone who needs extra training, which is certainly true; but i know i could be caught up to speed as a full time employee in about 6 months given my past experience and ability to learn. so the question: are there positions/companies you know of who are willing to accept the risk of training someone with a non-cs degree? if so, who, and how can i find more positions to up my chances? lastly, in your opinion, do i even have a chance?

i completed extracurricular research projects outside of work/school which i really enjoyed and have put on my resume, but i recognize my time commitment to work is hindering my ability to research more and to learn more   techniques. this is why i wholeheartedly believe the best way for me to learn is to find someone willing to accept the risk of training me, as the learning environment of full time engagement cannot be beat. thanks for reading, and i hope i don't sound too batshit. if i do, and you wish to shoot me down, go ahead. i'm still going to try to break in to the field anyway.",advice on getting into the field,0,32,3251,6,"hello,

i kind of hit a wall, at least in my mind. creating dimension tables is just fine but it's the facts table\* i'm struggling with.




here is a timetable of my trains. you can see the following:

\- maggie left berlin and arrived in neuchatel on the 4th, had a 1 day transit time, so instead of leaving later that day, she left on the 5th

datascience,"the answer to this quesiton might be rather simple but i lack the experience to know.

in it's most general form, this question is about the most compact  format to store a table of values with lot's of repeated values, e.g. for n columns:

|idx|1|2|3|4|...|n|
|---|-|-|-|-|---|-|
|idx1|1v1|2v1|3v1|4v1|...|nv1|
|idx2|1v1|**2v2**|3v1|4v1|...|nv1|
|idx3|**1v2**|2v2|3v1|**4v2**|...|nv1|
|idx4|1v2|**2v3**|3v1|4v2|...|**nv2**|
|idx5|1v2|2v3|**3v2**|4v2|...|nv2|
|idx6|**1v3**|2v3|3v2|4v2|...|nv2|

i emphasise where the values change from those in previous rows. the format of the example values here is simply that 'nvm' means the mth value ('v') of column n.

specifically, my application is a set of n quantities that are updating over time independently of each other, and i want to store the whole history of all quantities, the index being the time, i.e. it's basically a log recording when any of the values change, but they don't typically all change at the same time, only a few change at once.

a starting point might be to consider storing it as a csv with unchanged values being left blank:

```
time,1,2,3,4,...,n
t1,1v1,2v1,3v1,4v1,...,nv1
t2,,2v2,,,...,
t3,1v2,,,4v2,...,
t4,,2v3,,,...,nv2
t5,,,3v2,,...,
t6,1v3,,,,...,
```
when reading the , the empty values in a row can then be forward-filled from the last time the value of that quantity changed.

the issue here is that for large n, that's a lot (n-1) of redundant commas increasing the size of the file, and the number of commas remains the same for each new row, even if only one or two values have changed.

hence the next idea is not storing it as a csv to generate a table out of, and instead just including on each new line only those quantities that had changed with their new values:
```
time,1,2,3,4,...,n
t1,1v1,2v1,3v1,4v1,...,nv1
t2,2:2v2
t3,1:1v2,4:4v2
t4,2:2v3,n:nv2
t5,3:3v2
t6,1:1v3
```
the format here being that 'x:new_value' means quantity x has changed value to new_value. assuming all characters and the column headings are 1 byte each, ths saves a constant n-1 bytes per row and only adds 3 bytes per updated value (column header, colon, comma) in the row, so the result is smaller in size as long as the number of values changing in each row remains smaller than (n-1)/3.

is there any better and more efficient way than this? overall, in addition to minimal file size, i'm looking for:
- a solution with fast appending of new  on the fly
- when reading the , something that allows efficiently isolating both by time to see what quantities changed at that time (ideally without having to traverse all previous times to get there), and by quantity to see at what times it that quantity changed (ideally without having to traverse other quantities to get there).",most efficient format for storing a table with repeated column values,0,69,2767,11,"the answer to this quesiton might be rather simple but i lack the experience to know.

1. offer 1: axtria insights (life s consulting)— decision  analyst
2. offer 2: bdo (accounting, financial services)— forensic   associate

the pros of axtria (offer 1) is that i will be utilizing more machine learning and  engineering in my projects. i know axtria is one of the world's fastest growing life  firms, and thus can provide me a good start in the life s vertical and could be used as a platform to get me into firms like zs, iqvia, etc.

on the other hand bdo (offer 2) is located in a city i am much more fond of (where i know i will experience more personal growth), is a more established consulting firm (albeit in a different industry), and the work seems to be a lot more interesting— the whole idea of using analytics to help identify fraud on massive levels, working with some of the world's top lawyers, and being able to testify in courts sounds amazing. however, my biggest fear is that— although the team does do some ml and  engineering— they primarily use sql and tableau/powerbi as that is generally what their clients need. i don't necessarily have a problem with that; however, i feel that— especially with today's job market— it's better to be have more technically rigorous work under your belt in order to have job security.

datascience," so we had a task at work that wasn't assigned to me, but i wanted to try and practice anyway.

we received a table which contains 27,000 ids that have a loan amount, term, contract interest and effective interest. our task was to build a table that contains all the ammortization tables of each id. so for example if the first id has 12 terms, then we need to add 12 rows which contain the id, loan amount, pmt, int, prn and term number. if the second id has 30 terms, we need to build 30 rows, etc.

my colleagues decided to build a loop in sql, but i wanted to try and practice it with python.

so at home, i built a dummy test  that contains 4 ids which have loan amount, term, contract interest and effective interest.

i uploaded it to sql, then calculated the monthly interest and added it additional column, then i calculated the pmt using numpy\_financial.

next step for me, was to build a table that contain id, int, prn and term and only after i build this table, i will calculate the prn and int, while adding the pmt via merge function. the reason for that was that i was using a loop, so i didn't want the loop to run too slow.

i built the table with the following code:

%%timeit  
df2 = pd.frame(columns = \['id','prn', 'int' , 'term'\])  
for index, row in df.iterrows():  
for i in range(1,int(row\['term'\])+1,1):  
    df2=df2.append({'id':int(row\['id'\]),'prn':'','int':'','term':i},ignore\_index = true)  
df2

the code took 275 ms per loop for 4 loans that i uploaded. with 27,000 loans, it will be extremely slow.

\*\*note:the row in iterrows refers to the df frame, which is the loans table that i uploaded. the df2 is the new amortization table that i want to build, prior to performing the additional required calculations.

should i keep on doing the production course or it doesn't have much value if i'm not already in a company trying to implement those things? or maybe finish that first and then learn at least etls? big  technologies?

long story short - i'm a  analyst for a small retail company. very small  team (started 2 people, now 4 people). it was really great at first as i would get to touch everything  related (frim  viz to dba to small heuristic models to api development, etc.). however, as a result, i'm feeling stretched all over the place and unable to gain significant knowledge in any area (im slowly learning about each instead of rapidly about one).

so, i started looking at the job market and found an interesting job - although one that looked too senior for my current status, and that paid 3x as much as i make (which seems too good to be true).

its a senior  scientist job posted by this company called crossover - contracting for another company called totogi. 

so, i applied for kicks and lo and behold, they screen using assessments (codesignal, english and a little quiz). curious, i did the assessments and now i have an interview.

now, i see awful reviews about them that date a few years ago (spyware on the computer for example). but the money is apprently legit, and from the job description it looks like i'd do a lot of technical work, which i enjoy doing, and hopefully helps me further my ds skills.

before i waste more time with the interview or even take the plunge by mistake, anyone interviewed/worked for them could give me a heads up on what its like for a  scientist there? or worked for a similar type of company? 

i mean, even if i lasted 1 year there, i'd make as much money as 3 years at my current one... i'm tempted if the work is actually beneficial on a resume (ie is good experience and not just grinding out bug fixes or  entry)

datascience,"regardless of what application, i was trying build a model that attributed the total amount paid towards each payment stage. 

premise:

we expect the customer to pay in four payments, where each payment triggers a different business processes:

30% deposit makes x happen
30% 1st payment makes y happen
30% 2nd payment initiates the job full steam ahead
10% finale payment makes z happen 

rules:

the business process always includes all four steps
all the steps are always in the same order 
the percentages are always the same
the amounts due are different

question:

if for example based on our percentages-- 

the deposit will be $3000
1st payment $3000
2nd ""payment"" $3000
final $90 

and the customer pays $7,000.

instead of manually filling in each amount, i want the amount paid to automatically attribute 3k to the deposit, 3k to the 1st payment, and 1k to the 2nd payment. 

in power bi, i had a ""if (), true, false statement"" started:

column 1
deposit due= if([amount paid]&gt;= ([contract_total*.3), 0,(contract_total]*.3)-([amount paid]))

column 2
1st payment = if([amount paid]&gt;= ([contract total]*.6), 0,([contract_total]*.6)-[amount paid]))

when i put in $7k it worked brilliantly with the appropriate ""due"" amounts coming out to $0 amount due in column 1 and 2. 

even when i did $4k, column 1 would be $0 amount due and column 2 would be $2k (1k less). 

but something went wrong when i tried to replicate it beyond the first two payments/columns.

per the rules, of r/ this is ""not stack overflow"". i am just looking to read up on some documentation or discussion on how to do it (not even necessarily in power bi) so that when i to return to it, i can have a better handle on what i am actually doing and spend less time troubleshooting it, in a haphazard ""see if this works"" type of way.","what is the concept/equation, to look into for this problem?",0,60,1829,10,"regardless of what application, i was trying build a model that attributed the total amount paid towards each payment stage. 

premise:

we expect the customer to pay in four payments, where each payment triggers a different business processes:

30% deposit makes x happen
30% 1st payment makes y happen
30% 2nd payment initiates the job full steam ahead
10% finale payment makes z happen 

rules:

the business process always includes all four steps
all the steps are always in the same order 
the percentages are always the same
the amounts due are different

question:

if for example based on our percentages-- 

the deposit will be $3000
1st payment $3000
2nd ""payment"" $3000
final $90 

and the customer pays $7,000.

instead of manually filling in each amount, i want the amount paid to automatically attribute 3k to the deposit, 3k to the 1st payment, and 1k to the 2nd payment. 

in power bi, i had a ""if (), true, false statement"" started:

column 1
deposit due= if([amount paid]&gt;= ([contract_total*.3), 0,(contract_total]*.3)-([amount paid]))

column 2
1st payment = if([amount paid]&gt;= ([contract total]*.6), 0,([contract_total]*.6)-[amount paid]))

when i put in $7k it worked brilliantly with the appropriate ""due"" amounts coming out to $0 amount due in column 1 and 2. 

even when i did $4k, column 1 would be $0 amount due and column 2 would be $2k (1k less). 

but something went wrong when i tried to replicate it beyond the first two payments/columns.

hi all, thanks in advance for your advice.

i'm trying to determine whether certain product feature improvements increased the number of monthly active users (active is defined as whether the user made a purchase in the last 28 days). we have the ability to a/b test but i'm getting stuck because this mau metric is a moving window metric. if we run the experiment for exactly 28 days then i think calculating the impact to mau is easy. but most of the time our experiments run for more or less days than 28 days. below are a few scenarios to illustrate my point.

note: all scenarios are a/b tests where we split our user base into equal treatment and control groups. so far, i been calculating ""mau rate"", which is the proportion of users who placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment.

* scenario 1: run experiment for exactly 28 days. at the end of 28 days, simply compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order.
* scenario 2: run experiment for less than 28 days, say 14 days. at the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. the issue is that this will include days from before the experiment started. if i use only the days during the experiment, then i'm not really measuring mau since mau is 28 days and the experiment ran for only 14 days.
* scenario 3: run experiment for more than 28 days, say 35 days. at the end of the experiment, compare the proportion of users in each group that placed an order in the last 28 days as of the last day of the experiment. the issue is that this will exclude  from the first 7 days of the experiment. if i use all the days during the experiment, then i'm not really measuring mau since mau is 28 days and the experiment ran for 35 days.

for instance, if on the river (last betting round) **player a** bets and **player b** thinks that **a** are bluffing, then **b** may call with a weak hand (5 card poker combination) given they have so-called blocker., i.e. a card **player b** holds which reduces the number of strong combinations **player a** may be betting with. similarly, they may have an anti-blocker. it's the same idea mathematically but used in slightly different scenarios.

i’ve been working as a junior  analyst for the last 8 months. 

the onboarding phase was really disorganised, i’d spend my time reading through documentation and getting familiar with whatever i could. 

i got my first project to work on around 6 weeks into the job. it was suppose to be just a dashboard but ended up being an automation piece so it was taken over by senior members in the team. 

my second project came along a few months later, but the  engineer has been having ongoing issues with the  being sent over from an external provider, so that’s been a blocker, but the  modelling and dashboard design is done. 

i was given a third project 2 months ago, a simple  model clean up and redesign of an existing dashboard, that didn’t take long and the dashboard is live now.

it is the new year now and i truly have nothing to do. the last 8 months has been me looking for work to do, i’ve asked to help out on other team member projects but they said they didn’t need it. we have a daily stand up where we give updates and talk about what we’ll be doing today. today was the first day i couldn’t bs my way through the meeting and said i didn’t have an update. i feel really incompetent having nothing to do. it’s isn’t a fast paced company so there aren’t millions of things going on, and our  team didn’t exist just 4 years ago so the business doesn’t rely on us too much. 

only 3 projects in the last 8 months, is this normal? if you currently work in  was your first job similar to my experience?? i’m struggling to understand why they hired me in the first place, i don’t think there’s enough work for an extra person.

i got my first project to work on around 6 weeks into the job. it was suppose to be just a dashboard but ended up being an automation piece so it was taken over by senior members in the team. 

my second project came along a few months later, but the  engineer has been having ongoing issues with the  being sent over from an external provider, so that’s been a blocker, but the  modelling and dashboard design is done. 

i was given a third project 2 months ago, a simple  model clean up and redesign of an existing dashboard, that didn’t take long and the dashboard is live now.

it is the new year now and i truly have nothing to do. the last 8 months has been me looking for work to do, i’ve asked to help out on other team member projects but they said they didn’t need it. we have a daily stand up where we give updates and talk about what we’ll be doing today. today was the first day i couldn’t bs my way through the meeting and said i didn’t have an update. i feel really incompetent having nothing to do. it’s isn’t a fast paced company so there aren’t millions of things going on, and our  team didn’t exist just 4 years ago so the business doesn’t rely on us too much. 

only 3 projects in the last 8 months, is this normal? if you currently work in  was your first job similar to my experience?? i’m struggling to understand why they hired me in the first place, i don’t think there’s enough work for an extra person.

should i start looking for another job? i don’t want to come up to the one year mark without much experience under my belt. i want to be a crucial member of a team.junior  analyst (23m) no responsibilities at work"

**my background :** master's degree in computer . double major in aerospace and cs, with a minor in business and finance to be more precise, internships in aerospace systems architecture and business development. good background in maths, but i would like to develop my ds and ml/ai skills.

**my goal :** in any case, i would like to work at most 3 years in any of the following companies, in order to negotiate a better salary. might be tough but i would love to have a shot at a faang company in the future. moving in the us is something i strongly consider, within 3-7 years.

**offer a :**

\- compensation : 44k+ bonus and equity (expecting alongside 45-50k tc)

\- scale up in the insurance technology : fraud detection (in e-commerce, healthcare, insurance). the company seems to have a product that gets adapted to the client’s needs (saas). valued at over a billion.

\- existence of a us branch if i want to x3 my salary in the future.

\- c# programming for solutions (so maybe more of an hybrid ds 

\- a little stats and maths for clients  analysis and see if the projects holds up.

\- very little machine learning from what i gathered (depends on projects).

\- lots of client interaction (insurance companies mostly) and stakeholder management.

\- more working hours (40-50 range).

\- a lot of freedom (full / partial remote when feeling like it, the results are what matter).

\- young team, full of energy that seem very pleasant from the interactions i had with them !

\- maybe not that important but it seems there are 4 times more competition for this offer rather than the other one.

\-offer really appeals to me, but idk if i will like coding in c# that much, might want to give it a go to see. and i would like a little more ml.

**company b :**

\- compensation : expecting 40k-42k tc, in a less expensive city.

\- a big aerospace company, within a branch developing   solutions for satellites (10 or so ds).

\- mobility on other branches of the aerospace company is possible. apparently in other countries as well, though going to the us might be hard considering this is relative to national defense.

\- expecting ml/ai and optimization techniques review. talking with the various engineering teams in charge of the satellites (thermal, electronics, …) and trying to build ds/ml solutions to help them out, for exemple, predictive maintenance models that are with low calculation time. implementation in python using tools such as tensorflow and other ds libraries. side projects on digital twin technology with r

\- not that much pressure (35h contract, can easily have friday afternoons off)

\- partial remote authorized, 2-4 days a week.

\- evolving within a team that’s quite young, but a lot of lengthy administrative processes due to the size of the company. the manager would want me to fight alongside him in a couple years, in order to push forward   projects to get better funds.

\- salary growth is really regularized at this company and you should not expect big jumps.

\- i like the aerospace industry, but dislike the long processes, and i am afraid to limit my opportunities to aerospace ds roles taking this offer.

\- a lot of freedom (full / partial remote when feeling like it, the results are what matter).

\- young team, full of energy that seem very pleasant from the interactions i had with them !

\- maybe not that important but it seems there are 4 times more competition for this offer rather than the other one.

\-offer really appeals to me, but idk if i will like coding in c# that much, might want to give it a go to see. and i would like a little more ml.

**company b :**

\- compensation : expecting 40k-42k tc, in a less expensive city.

\- a big aerospace company, within a branch developing   solutions for satellites (10 or so ds).

\- mobility on other branches of the aerospace company is possible. apparently in other countries as well, though going to the us might be hard considering this is relative to national defense.

\- expecting ml/ai and optimization techniques review. talking with the various engineering teams in charge of the satellites (thermal, electronics, …) and trying to build ds/ml solutions to help them out, for exemple, predictive maintenance models that are with low calculation time. implementation in python using tools such as tensorflow and other ds libraries. side projects on digital twin technology with r

\- not that much pressure (35h contract, can easily have friday afternoons off)

\- partial remote authorized, 2-4 days a week.

\- evolving within a team that’s quite young, but a lot of lengthy administrative processes due to the size of the company. the manager would want me to fight alongside him in a couple years, in order to push forward   projects to get better funds.

\- salary growth is really regularized at this company and you should not expect big jumps.

\- i like the aerospace industry, but dislike the long processes, and i am afraid to limit my opportunities to aerospace ds roles taking this offer.



kinda torn, as i like to have business oriented interactions, want to improve on ml while still being curious about other fields of  .

**question :** which of the 2 offers should i consider to achieve my goals?choosing first job offer as a  scientist"

i'm also all ears for any advice, tips or pointers you may have for someone trying to break into the industry with little to no experience. which skills were the most useful for you? **do you think you wasted time doing something?** how might you recommend i develop/practice the necessary skills?

about your job, i wonder what they liked about your -- obviously impressive -- resume that caught their eye. also what kind of tasks, programs and skills you use most often. is there a job position that is more entry level there or not really? i know the answer is likely no, but i wonder if there is an easier route to landing a job in  analytics and simply getting in the building.

please forgive me for writing such a long post! i'm spinning my wheels at the moment and trying to solidify a direction. i hope to be in a  analyst position one day. thank you so much for your time and help! i truly do appreciate any insight you have to share.

datascience,"so next to my main job i have an internship. there, my goal is to transform their excel tools (basically spreadsheet where they manually paste information from different input .csv files, run a few macros, do manual  checks and so on) into a python script to avoid any manual input. the output - csv file used as input for some software. 

now i am really strugling here. they have a material base built on excel. it has a list of materials and their physical properties. they key columns used for looking up the information have both somewhat standardized alloy ids, but also random part numbers (for when there is no alloy id), or text descriptions of parts. they say that everyone else in the company must follow these. 

now, the input files come from different teams, and each input file, in the key column, has random information, differently than agreed typed alloy ids, maybe some random comments or something else. 

if been strugling to use their excel base for 3 weeks now. whenever i want to join information from it to my input frame, i can not because it’s always a random text, or a different format, or something else. everytime i get new inputs there is something new that needs to be worked around. 

so my question is - what do i do? 

do i propose some kind of standardization and moving db from excel to something more strict about the types? 

do i just keep building these workarounds for every glitch that ever comes up? 

do i just leave that place? 

the whole company, apart from small it dept operates on excel sheets. i was hired for paid internship for one of the non-it teams to help them move away from using excel to coding  preparation tools in python, so i’m the only it person there. their main guy insists to get rid of all manual inputs, but everyone below him is not so keen to do that and whenever i say “for it to work we need to tell input providers to do this, and never do that” they respond “the world is not perfect, cant you make some exeption here so we can edit it manually?”. 

i’m going crazy here, i really can not keep making new fix for 1000 unexpected inputs that happened because there is no standard process, and then still leave it for them to fix it manually.

that's why i decided to take a step back to understand the fundaments before diving deep into a specific area. (i think this is really important for a non-cs engineer)

so i wanted to start this new direction with front-end and back-end development and then dive further into the backend related to  /engineering and accordingly take it from there.

here is how i structured it:

\- html 

\- javascript (not looking to learn any frameworks atm but just to understand the basics)

\- backend in either node.js or python (would prefer python but don't seem to find any good course for it)

\- figuring out the next steps...

so i completed learning html

target variable \~ context a (categorical) + context b (categorical) + context c (continuous)  


i am looking for a way to identify outliers in the target variable *given* the values for the contextual variables. in other words, if a row of  has a rare value for context a, it shouldn't automatically be an outlier, but rather be compared with more emphasis on variables b and c. in terms of  size, i have 100+ million rows and 6-8 contextual variables. it's a good  size for the largest categories, but not enough to just splice out by all the combinations of the categories.   


most of what i found online relates to ""context-dependent outlier detection"" but the papers are generally theoretical. other unsupervised methods like isolation forest still focuses on outliers with respective to all variables, rather than a single target with multiple contexts. i consider the possibility of building fitted models and checking residuals as a way of finding the largest deviations.

i’m starting with  . i went through the course from andrew ng on coursera. i know that this is just the surface and that  scientist are tough guys with phds in math or statistics and have experience in ml.
well i can’t change where i come from but i can decide my next steps.

so everything you can share with me would be of value for my next steps.

in the picture above is the course syllabus. i’m also reading the books naked statistics, hands on machine learning with scikit etc., practical statistics for  scientists, designing machine learning systems and so on. i’m honest with you. i don’t understand everything in the books and need to reread the chapters and do more research on some topics. i’m also not a proficient python programmer but i’m not afraid of learning this too.

so i really appreciate any support and help.

thank you for reading and helping with recommendations.

cheers!need some advice…"

thanks for reading up. as you read, no hardcore background in tech or statistics per-say. now here's what happened. in may 2022 i decided that i would want to continue my education and combine ds + pm skills to differentiate myself and build a competitive career. 

for context: i am married, have a mortgage and just had a child. going back to school full time did not make sense. after looking around i selected a particular program (please do not hate me). here's why i chose this particular program.  


\- i was able to study part time and complete the program in 6 months  
\- the program seemed comprehensive (happy to share the syllabus if someone would like to see)  
\- the faculty are practicing  scientists and the  founder has a long footprint in the ds/tech industry  
\- multiple projects along the way to graduation  
\- relatively affordable ($15k)  
\- after graduation - upon passing a test and if selected - placement as a ds intern in a ds consultancy firm to get experience in working on real projects (3-6 ds projects). i arranged to work on projects part time once i got to that point while continuing my full time job for the obvious financial reasons.



**my journey:**  


i started studying 3-4 months prior to the bootcamp start date. again, zero background in programming or anything tech related.  


\- spent two months on sql  
\- spent two months on python



bootcamp starts. initially i was fine and everything seemed to go smoothly and make sense. after 2 months as the program started to go beyond what i had already studied, i started to realized that the concepts were being covered at a very high level. there was no deep understanding or fundamental concept building. one week we did ""introduction to pandas"" and the next we were covering ""advanced pandas"". no. i do not want to half ass it and become an incompetent ds. i want to understand, grasp and apply the concepts. i need to know what i am doing. i want to have my fundamentals straight. i do not want to embarrass myself in interviews. i want to do this properly and competently.

what i decided:   
i decided to drop from the bootcamp and return in the future (have already paid). i plan to study on my own and get back in the program and use it as a refresher and then hopefully go get a placement and get some real ds experience.  


the plan:  
\- time spent studying up to date: 6 months ( 18 - 20 hours a week)  
\- continue studying for the next 6 months ( 18 - 20 hours a week)  
\- follow the syllabus provided by the program but take my time and self pace.  
\- i do not just watch tutorials but code along, work on guided projects and take my time with concepts/fundamentals.

**objective**: to become a   product manager

thanks for reading up. as you read, no hardcore background in tech or statistics per-say. now here's what happened. in may 2022 i decided that i would want to continue my education and combine ds + pm skills to differentiate myself and build a competitive career. 

for context: i am married, have a mortgage and just had a child. going back to school full time did not make sense. after looking around i selected a particular program (please do not hate me). here's why i chose this particular program.  


\- i was able to study part time and complete the program in 6 months  
\- the program seemed comprehensive (happy to share the syllabus if someone would like to see)  
\- the faculty are practicing  scientists and the  founder has a long footprint in the ds/tech industry  
\- multiple projects along the way to graduation  
\- relatively affordable ($15k)  
\- after graduation - upon passing a test and if selected - placement as a ds intern in a ds consultancy firm to get experience in working on real projects (3-6 ds projects). i arranged to work on projects part time once i got to that point while continuing my full time job for the obvious financial reasons.



**my journey:**  


i started studying 3-4 months prior to the bootcamp start date. again, zero background in programming or anything tech related.  


\- spent two months on sql  
\- spent two months on python



bootcamp starts. initially i was fine and everything seemed to go smoothly and make sense. after 2 months as the program started to go beyond what i had already studied, i started to realized that the concepts were being covered at a very high level. there was no deep understanding or fundamental concept building. one week we did ""introduction to pandas"" and the next we were covering ""advanced pandas"". no. i do not want to half ass it and become an incompetent ds. i want to understand, grasp and apply the concepts. i need to know what i am doing. i want to have my fundamentals straight. i do not want to embarrass myself in interviews. i want to do this properly and competently.

what i decided:   
i decided to drop from the bootcamp and return in the future (have already paid). i plan to study on my own and get back in the program and use it as a refresher and then hopefully go get a placement and get some real ds experience.  


the plan:  
\- time spent studying up to date: 6 months ( 18 - 20 hours a week)  
\- continue studying for the next 6 months ( 18 - 20 hours a week)  
\- follow the syllabus provided by the program but take my time and self pace.  
\- i do not just watch tutorials but code along, work on guided projects and take my time with concepts/fundamentals.  
\- i plan to do a statistics focused course relevant to ds  
\- i am not looking for a shortcut (no pun intended) but do want to continue moving forward in my learning and career.  


i understand that i do not a background in statistics, cs nor am i phd. i have to work with what i have but here i am - a product manager currently in the financial industry aspiring to work as a product manager in the ds field in the future.

 i would then get the future forecast range for these stocks (price prediction plus minus volatility prediction). if the range is fully below the current price with 95% confidence then i would remove that stock from my portfolio, if just the price prediction is below the current price then i would adjust the weight of that stock in my portfolio accord to how large the uncertainty of the future price is (volatility). my portfolio would be a subset of the stocks in the nasdaq just weighted differently and reweighted every week or month rather than the 6 months of the nasdaq company.

**shiny and javascript**

shiny has become the status quo of building web apps/dashboards with r. a  major reason of its success is that you don't need to know javascript  to create basic interactive web apps.  

although the concealment of this important feature is by design  and makes shiny in the first instance easy to use, in the long run when  you want to build serious and more visual appealing apps, you most  likely need to utilize javascript to make most of the web framework.    

learning  javascript doesn’t only benefit your shiny apps, the new acquired skill  set can be applied to other r web frameworks as well, such as opencpu  or used outside the r spectrum. since javascript is the lingua franca of  web development, it means that you can use js to create stunning user  interfaces (i.e. dashboards) for various other  (backend) languages,  such as python, skala, net, ... 

## how to get started with javascript

a frequently heard argument against javascript from shiny users or r  developers in general is the difficulty and the time consumption of  learning javascript. surprised to hear this coming from developers who  are familiar with a language (r) which is considered to be one of the  steepest language to master. the reality is that you don't need to  master javascript in depth to benefit from the language. a superficial  touch, enough to let a javascript library work, would be in most cases  sufficient  

furthermore, there are many js frameworks such as jquery (a  popular framework used intensively in shiny) that hide many  complexities, making js easier to use and to learn.  jquery is also  known as the ‘code less do more’ library

moreover, even yihui xie  (auhor of the popular knitr package), whose first task for rstudio was  to implement the js library table in shiny, admitted in a recent  blog that he didn’t have advanced js skills when creating the package,  and was frequently copying code from stackoverflow. this indicates that  you don’t have to be a js expert.

my personal experience is that  you rarely need advanced js skills to get most of a javascript library.  just like yihui, you can use the following strategy:

1. if you  have an idea on what you want to implement in your shiny app, search on  the internet for js libraries that can assist in achieving your goals.
2. having found a library that suits your need, read the documentation.
3. after  reading the documentation, look at the examples and use cases that are  accompanied with the library. you can try to mimic and play around with  the library on a playground such as jsfiddle    


following these 3 steps would be mostly sufficient  to get started. if you need more advanced usages of the js library, you  can use stackoverflow to explore questions and answers on the js  library. also, when you encounter errors / issues, stackoverflow is an  ideal place to find solutions.

## how to use javascript within shiny

generally, there are 3 ways to get started with javascript in shiny :

**method 1. htmlwidgets:**  
htmlwidgets  basically lets you integrate libraries into the r environment, which  means that in theory thousands of javascript libraries can be used from  r. there are already some built-in widgets which you can use out of the  box in shiny, such as the popular ""table"" widget that transforms r  frames into intereactive html tables. 

htmlwidgets can be  considered as a wrapper around the js library that you want to  integrate, making the communication between a js library and r more  convenient.

creating a htmlwidget follows the following conventions:

* dependencies, these are the javascript libraries for which you want to write an r wrapper.
* r binding. this is the r function that you can call, and where you define the parameters, and how the widget is rendered.
* javascript  binding, a javascript function serving as a middle layer between the r  binding (r) and the dependencies (javascript). the  and options are  gathered from the r binding and passed to the underlying dependencies.   


to have a feeling of how to implement an htmlwidget, you can have a look at the skeleton of ""table"" at github.

**method 2. call javascript from shiny:**  
 a big advantage of creating an htmlwidget is that it can be used as an r  package, which can be utilized outside shiny in other r projects as  well. disadvantage is that it takes time and debugging efforts to build  htmlwidgets. another less time intensive way is calling javascript  directly from shiny via so-called callbacks. this process entails two  layers:

**2a. session$sendcustommessage** r function (sendcustommessage) that outputs r objects to javascript  

the session$sendcustommessage(type, object)function lives in r, and contains two parameters:

* type, a unique name of the callback.
* object, the  you want to convey.  

**2b. shiny.addcustommessagehandler. the javascript middle layer:**

shiny.addcustommessagehandler  lives in javascript and serves as a middle layer between r and  javascript. on the one hand it ‘receives’ the r object as passed by  session$sendcustommessage (see a), on the other hand it passes the  object to the javascript dependencies that you want to utilize in your  app.

shiny.addcustommessagehandler(type, javascriptfunction), contains two parameters:

* type, the name of the callback as defined in (a).
* javascriptfunction is the javascript function, consuming the r object.

 **fictive example** 

in  r we define a .frame “df” which is subsequently conveyed to js  for  each slider change event by using the session$sendcustommessage  function:

    df &lt;- .frame(klm = c(1:100)) observeevent(input$slider,              {session$sendcustommessage(""handler1"",df)})  }

in js we consume the conveyed .frame as follows:

    shiny.addcustommessagehandler(""handler1"", hello); function hello (message){   alert(json.stringify(message)); }

so shiny.addcustommessagler lives in js, passes the r  object “df” to the hello js function, which alerts the object on the  screen.

noteworthy is that communication between r and javascript  takes place through json. hence, calling json.stringify to convert the  .frame object from json to a string object.

#### method 3. send an object from javascript to shiny

sending  messages from shiny to javascript is not always sufficient, sometimes  you want to enable the way around by sending objects from js to shiny.  this entails the following two steps:

3a) shiny.oninputchange(id, object) lives in js and conveys js objects to r, and contains two parameters:

* id = the unique id of the js object you want to convey to r.
* object = js object to be conveyed to r.

3b) read in r ,the js object by referencing the unique id as defined in 3a).

fictive example:

in js you send the following js message object to r when an action button is hovered:   

    $(document).ready(function() {   $( ""#gobutton"" ).hover(function(){     var message = {id: ""id1"",  : [1,2], nonce: math.random()};     shiny.oninputchange(""getjs"", message);   }); });      

in r you read the js object as follows:

    observeevent(input$getjs, cat(“js object received”)",why you should learn javascript to master r shiny   projects. and how to get started,0,95,7440,17,"the following article was first published on [

datascience,"hi y'all, first off, i'm an absolute beginner regarding statistics, therefore my probably trivial question.

i recently did an online survey, where people could list their personal problems regarding a specific topic and then ""weigh"" them individually, using a contingent of 10 points. (if they had only listed one problem, they had to use up their 10 points, thus weighting their only problem with 10 points, while other participants possibly had to distribute their contingent)

the goal of the survey is to find out the ""importance"" of each problem and then publish it. (each participant is equally or at least similarly experienced and can be considered an expert)

the problem is, that some people have listed completely different problems than others, in many cases, there is no overlap at all.

for example, the results look like this (""-"" indicating that the person has not listed the problem)



||person 1|person 2|person 3|person 4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|problem a|10|4|\-|\-|
|problem b|\-|1|3|\-|
|problem c|\-|2|3|\-|
|problem d|\-|3|4|\-|
|problem e|\-|\-|\-|5|
|problem f|\-|\-|\-|5|



simply taking the average of each weight for each problem feels wrong to me. people who have listed 3 problems, which may all be equally important, could have given problem xy 3 points, while another participant who only voted on problem xy  would have given it 10 points - thus ""skewing"" the average. (if i am wrong, please correct me here)

but how would i calculate it correctly?

let's say we want to calculate the importance of problem a, which 2 people (person 1 

person 1 has only voted on problem a, thus rating it with 10 points. person 2 has slightly more experience and thus voted on 4 problems in total, rating problem a with 4 points.

my approach would be the following (e.g. for problem a)

1. check who has voted on problem a
2. of all those people, what person listed the most problems? (person 2, 4 problems)
3. how many problems did this person vote on? -&gt; it's 4!
4. go through each person (who has mentioned problem a) and calculate this:( problem a score ) \* ( number of probs. person voted on / 4 ), thus receiving a ""normalized"" score
5. add the result of each person up and then divide it by the number of persons who have voted on problem a (2)

in this case, the ""importance"" of problem a would be: (see table above)  
(10 \* (1/4) + 4 \*(4/4)) / 2 = **3,25**

problem b: (1 \* (4/4) + 3 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **1,625**  
problem c: (2 \* (4/4) + 3 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **2,125**  
problem d: (3 \* (4/4) + 4 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **3**  
problem e: (5\*(2/2)) / 1 = **5**  
problem f: (5\*(2/2)) / 1 = **5**

(if they had only listed one problem, they had to use up their 10 points, thus weighting their only problem with 10 points, while other participants possibly had to distribute their contingent)

the goal of the survey is to find out the ""importance"" of each problem and then publish it. (each participant is equally or at least similarly experienced and can be considered an expert)

the problem is, that some people have listed completely different problems than others, in many cases, there is no overlap at all.

for example, the results look like this (""-"" indicating that the person has not listed the problem)



||person 1|person 2|person 3|person 4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|problem a|10|4|\-|\-|
|problem b|\-|1|3|\-|
|problem c|\-|2|3|\-|
|problem d|\-|3|4|\-|
|problem e|\-|\-|\-|5|
|problem f|\-|\-|\-|5|



simply taking the average of each weight for each problem feels wrong to me. people who have listed 3 problems, which may all be equally important, could have given problem xy 3 points, while another participant who only voted on problem xy  would have given it 10 points - thus ""skewing"" the average. (if i am wrong, please correct me here)

but how would i calculate it correctly?

let's say we want to calculate the importance of problem a, which 2 people (person 1 

person 1 has only voted on problem a, thus rating it with 10 points. person 2 has slightly more experience and thus voted on 4 problems in total, rating problem a with 4 points.

my approach would be the following (e.g. for problem a)

1. check who has voted on problem a
2. of all those people, what person listed the most problems? (person 2, 4 problems)
3. how many problems did this person vote on? -&gt; it's 4!
4. go through each person (who has mentioned problem a) and calculate this:( problem a score ) \* ( number of probs. person voted on / 4 ), thus receiving a ""normalized"" score
5. add the result of each person up and then divide it by the number of persons who have voted on problem a (2)

in this case, the ""importance"" of problem a would be: (see table above)  
(10 \* (1/4) + 4 \*(4/4)) / 2 = **3,25**

problem b: (1 \* (4/4) + 3 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **1,625**  
problem c: (2 \* (4/4) + 3 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **2,125**  
problem d: (3 \* (4/4) + 4 \* (3/4)) / 2 = **3**  
problem e: (5\*(2/2)) / 1 = **5**  
problem f: (5\*(2/2)) / 1 = **5**

can i do this? is this the best way of doing this? thank you so much!how can i correctly evaluate the results of this survey? (added my approach, please criticize)"

datascience,"i am completing my   undergraduate degree in the next 4 months. 

after graduation, i have a full-time  scientist offer at a well-known finance company. 

also applied to master's programs in ds and expect to pursue my master's while working full-time.

my goal is to be a principal/senior  scientist in tech or fintech.

quick story:

i recently became very passionate about machine learning (especially nlp) as i had a chance to work on a complex internship project with a team of ph.d.  scientists during my last internship. before that internship, i worked as a  analytics intern that mainly did flexdashboards and shiny apps using an r programming language for the same company. 

throughout these experiences, i noticed how programming was the main focus of both internships but had different scopes (da vs ds). i think working with ph.d. people influenced me to love machine learning much more than da, as the project had more depth than any machine learning or statistics course i took at my college. it also forced me to do research and self-study stats and ml to deliver the project requirements on time. 

on the other hand, i saw how smart these ph.d. people are, i don't think i can ever do a doctorate in statistics or cs as i don't possess the academic intelligence they do. in the future, i  want to work in the mle/ds domain, but don't know how far i can go without a ph.d.

during college, i did comprehensive internship projects in the ds domain which led me to have a very competitive resume. also, my programming abilities led me to pass technical interviews much easier. however, in the future other people will catch up to my technical abilities and almost everyone will have their master's as well. what do i do and how do i keep improving as a ds so i won't feel like i stupid person next to phds?

i am open to advise and career tips from anyone. since i have a good offer, am done with masters apps, and am almost done with my undergrad i have been thinking about what to do next to achieve my dreams.

since programming was always around me in my childhood (my dad works as a software engineer at a mid-size company), and still is through my classmates often working on their app all night long, i thought studying computer  (at tum) would be the right career path for me.

so, why should i study cs? at this point, i could just study mathematics. the curriculum of the mathematics b.sc. at tum also looks a lot more fascinating than cs (more analysis, less transition graphs). the subsidiary subject would be cs tho.

3. what do you learn about  communication from this example?

i chose the *2018 information is beautiful awards* winner, *a night under the stars* for this particular essay as i was drawn the beauty of it. however, i am not sure which chart exactly does this fall into.

datascience,"i am use to sql on premise with limited support, so normally i would have a secure folder set up and link csv files from the folder into access to upload to sql then run a stored procedure to normalize and upset into production tables. i would have that scheduled thru a bat file to run periodically. but i'm at a new company and they are all cloud based.

i'm a 20 year old guy from denmark thinking hard of all the different education-possibilities. i have always been into pc's, hardware and software, since my father is a software-engenieer and i have always thought that was cool. maths has also always been an interest for me and has been coming to me quite naturally. some years ago i saw some videos about artificial intelligence and machine learning and got really interrested in the idea of a program (algorithm) being able to learn from .  
my question is tho;  
what is your experience with working as a scientist?  
is it worth it? (does it bring joy or excitement, is it worth your pay, is work a hassle or do you look forward to going to work?)  
for me it is important to have a well paying job to provide for a future family, but i also don't want a job where it feels like im running a marathon each day, coming home extremely used up and tired of work.

datascience,"i thought i would make this post because i imagine that a lot of this sub is in a similar position to mine while searching for an internship in college.

first to start off, here is a bit about what is on my resume:

* junior at a university with decent credibility. studying statistics with a   emphasis. 4.0 gpa.
* worked as a  consulting intern last summer at a large accounting firm doing a lot of  engineering-type work. used mostly sql and python.
* other work experience is as an advertising analyst for a large church, a linear algebra teaching assistant, and a  analyst at a start-up accounting firm.
* i listed r, python, sql, and linux as languages i am proficient in. also mentioned advanced statistics, mathematics, french fluency, and some soft skills.
* some activities i listed were:   club leadership, personal projects, and case competitions.

i would guess that i applied to around 120 internships. 10 of these were through career fairs and the rest online. most of the positions that i applied to online were based in nyc or dc as well as remote options. i looked mostly for internships through ziprecruiter, handshake, and linkedin. i also only applied to jobs that didn't state that they wouldn't accept cpt.

so here are my results:

* i did around 15 pre-recorded interviews as well as maybe 5 coding assessments.
* i heard back from around 30 companies saying that they were not interested.
* i interviewed with 5 companies.
* ultimately, i received an offer from 4 companies for an internship.

experience with each offer (from least to most exciting to me):

* the least exciting was with an advertising agency working as an ""analyst"". i just applied for the position through their website. for the pre-interview, they had me send in some basic analysis from some e-commerce . i did one interview with a recruiter and he tested my basic problem-solving acumen. i then was asked to do 4 more interviews that covered a lot of topics but technical skills were not one of them. i received an offer for their chicago office for $20/hour without relocation benefits. i think the biggest pro of this company was that it had a great culture. i definitely thought i could have enjoyed this job but it wasn't what i am looking for now to gain more   experience. ultimately, i didn't choose this internship because i felt like i would not get strong technical development. none of the people who even interviewed me knew how to code and some asked me what   is. i also asked the recruiter how much i could expect to get paid if offered a full-time job and he said $60k which is significantly lower than i would hope for.
* the next offer came from a campus recruiting event at my university. the company is a large manufacturer of air conditioners. they interviewed me on campus and asked a lot of technical and problem-solving questions. i then did one more interview over zoom that asked about my sql skills. i was offered $22 an hour, subsidized housing, and paid relocation. although it was a good offer, i choose not to accept it for a few reasons. it was based in an area of the country where i was not interested in living and where i have no family or connections. also, the work and company culture were not very interesting. i think i would have done a lot of menial  engineering tasks that would not have pushed my technical development.
* (these last two offers were difficult to choose between because i liked them both a lot) i applied to an event for a large bank on their website. i did a really simple coding assessment and they contacted me saying that i was accepted to the event. they flew me across the country and i participated in a hack-a-thon. it was really fun and throughout the event, each team had mentors that were senior  scientists that gave advice to the teams while also assessing our skills. a few months later, i got a call saying they would like to know my location preference, and then the next day i had an offer. they said that this offer was a result of my performance in the hack-a-thon. they are paying $45 an hour as well as a $2500 relocation bonus. the internship would be focused specifically on   and artificial intelligence. i think i would definitely have grown in technical skills doing this job but after reading online some people's experiences at this workplace, it seemed that besides the fact that they paid well, people did not really enjoy working for this bank. i also already did a fintech internship so i think trying out a different industry would be really beneficial. i was excited to move across the country for the summer to do this internship but after not being offered any corporate housing, it was difficult to find affordable short-term leases. i definitely would have gone with this internship if i didn't get the other more lucrative opportunity.
* the offer i ultimately decided to accept came from applying online to a large healthcare provider. i did not hear back from them for a long time but then out of the blue, i got a call asking if i could interview the next day. i did a 40-minute call with a  scientist that tested a lot of my technical skills from coding to statistics. i then was told that i made it to the final round of interviews and did three back-to-back interviews in a two-hour period. the first was a more in-depth technical assessment with another senior  scientist, the second was a problem-solving interview by a manager, and the third was a behavior assessment by another senior  scientist. almost immediately following the interviews, i was called by the recruiter and given an offer. it was a completely remote   internship for $47 an hour. i really like the idea of working in the healthcare industry and a lot of the people i met at the company were really friendly. in all the interviews they gave me lots of time to ask questions and it sounded like the company culture was really healthy. i think the only con i had for this opportunity is that for starting out in a technical field, i feel like being able to work in person would help me gain more concrete experience. i overcame this thought, however, after talking to one of the team managers who assured me that i would be challenged and given tasks where i could grow my skillset. i also think that the flexibility of being able to work remotely and not have to relocate helped me make this decision.

the most fun question i was asked during the interviews was, how many golf balls could fit in a school bus? i have also received emails from companies asking if i would like to interview with them for other   internships but since i accepted the healthcare provider's offer, i have declined to interview. this means that there could have potentially been more interviews and offers. 

i hope that sharing my experience can help other people as they try to find internships while still in university. i spent about a half an hour a day applying to 100+ positions over the past few months but all the offers definitely made it worth it. good luck with your internship searches!",my experience searching for a   internship,0,53,7168,8,"i thought i would make this post because i imagine that a lot of this sub is in a similar position to mine while searching for an internship in college.

fast forward a couple internships and i'm at my current job. i been here for a couple years now (first full time position) as a ' scientist'. i was here originally as an intern but converted. the original intention of the team, and my role, was to do  /ml work in the traditional sense. unfortunately, me and the other  scientists don't do ds work. my role has essentially transformed into a  engineering role, where i handle etl pipelines for the reports that the bi folks on the team do. this isn't to say that i don't find value in my work and i do use related skills, like sql. i don't hate it. but, it's frustrating that the one ml project proposal we come up with keeps getting pushed back.. the 'promise' that was made a couple years ago just isn't happening, and it's impacting my motivation a lot. i think its time to move on.  


but here's my problem. i'm worried that my skillset has moved away from the type of work i want to be doing. i worry that i locked myself into a  engineering career. this wouldn't be a bad thing if  i was an engineer working directly with ml pipelines. then i would at least have some exposure. even though my title and job description *is* that of a 'traditional'  scientist, i have no recent projects to speak on.  my resume isn't as impressive it should be for a  scientist 4 years into their career (counting internships).   


what should i do? i'm scared that the transition back to more explicit ds work will come with a pay cut (going from mid-level position back to entry-level), because  i have no recent projects. my core skills (python, r, etc.) are weaker than they should be from not using them as much. my initial plan is to retouch on those skills and poke around on kaggle, even the toy sets, to show something. otherwise, i considered trying to get an ibm or google ds certificate, but this feels like a waste considering i have a master's degree and grad certification in ml/ai. what are your thoughts?","help, i'm a ' scientist' but i'm actually a  engineer",0,61,3395,11,"**tl:dr: i have a background in ds, but even as a ' scientist', i do 100% de work. would like to move closer to ds. don't hate my job, but losing patience. feel like i trapped myself and lost touch with my ds skillset. considering building portfolio via kaggle or similar, while job searching. need advice on how to transition back.**

i googled several combinations of keywords that included 'investment banking', 'portfolio management', 'portfolio risk analysis', etc, and only found one set that is already cleaned and analyzed and used for their own report as part of an essay. other things google found were essays and articles of people presumably in the industry or academia doing research.

so reddit it is ...

1. can you think of any sources for this kind of sets? anonymized but with a significant number of variables and values?

2. if you happen to work in finance, what kind of report/outcome do you like to receive from your analyst/ colleagues? any advice or pointers are very welcome. i can make 30 formal-looking diagrams in power bi, but if only two of them are actually valuable, the others are just clutter.

🔥 we’re thrilled to introduce bastionlab, our simple privacy framework for   collaboration! to see what remote  exploration looks like when all privacy concerns are automatically handled for you, you can check [our github](
# built for sensitive  collaboration

collaboration between  owners and  scientists is a big challenge for highly regulated fields like health, finance, or advertising due to security and privacy issues. when collaborating remotely,  owners have to open their whole set, often through a jupyter notebook. this too-broad access creates huge privacy gaps because too many operations are allowed, which enables  scientists to extract information from the remote infrastructure (print the whole base, save the set in the weights, etc). 

⚙️ bastionlab solves this problem by providing fine-grained access control. it guarantees  owners that  scientists can only perform privacy-friendly operations on their  and that only anonymized outputs are shared with them.

# how does bastionlab work?

bastionlab makes sure that the  owner’s remote  is never accessed directly by the  scientist. three main elements ensure this: 

* first, a ‘safe zone’ is defined by the  owner to filter the  scientist’s queries, which enforces control while allowing for interactivity. 
* second, expressivity is limited. this means that the type of operations that can be executed by the  scientists is restricted to avoid arbitrary code execution. 
* finally, the  scientist never accesses the set locally. they only manipulate a local object that contains meta to interact with the remotely hosted set - and  owners can always see the calls made by that object. 

# ready to try?

how do i properly call the predict function so i don't get this error?  i tried updating the model's offset by doing

model$offset &lt;- log(test\_df$distance)

predictions  &lt;- predict(model, type = ""response"", new = test\_df)



but the warning still pops up.in r, how would you account for the offset term when doing predict? [q]"

so i have 8 separate spreadsheets, filled up with stock market trading  (backtesting),  and i'm stuck in professionally filtering and comparing the outcomes.  
e.g. in 1 spreadsheet there are  from \~700 trades that have taken place, with 6 diffent criteria noted down for each of them (including date, time, size of the market move etc.) to each of the trades, there are several outcomes percentage wise. (e.g. if it reaches a pre-defined level, i close the trade or if it reaches 1:2 risk reward ratio i close the trade etc.)

i would like to evaulate this  the best way possible. i'd like to see that how each result column depends on each of the criterias.  basically, i want to compare the % of return based on a lot of existing  to see what aspect can definitely, statistically, produce a profit. 

 e.g. ""some criteria"" if &gt;=x then its 80% going to have a losing result. alternatively, if &lt;=y then it will have a 60% positive result. 

 tl,dr: i would like to examine how the profitability of trading positions statistically depends on e.g. the size of the marke move, and so on, with 6 different criteria like this. and if this has been calculated, i’d need a summary of them altogether to see, that how each individually calculated and optimized parameter would fit with each other. this would provide me the final product, the best possible outcome from this .

i tried to evaulate by trial and error, by just filtering them in excel, then i got into pivot tables, which simplified it a bit, but still a huge amount of work, and just too much possiblities.   
do you guys have any recommendations in terms of evaulating, or what software to use for this? maybe tableau could be better in visualizing the  statisctically, then cutting out the losing trades that way? any recommendations on how to optimize, and compare the results?

your help and guidance would be really appreciated!

the basic tools online and in excel seem not to be self adjusting based on how much text i want to put into the image (some fields require a lot of it). so i would like to find an online tool which can create a beautiful visual representation for me and which would automatically adjust the size of the diagram fields. 

i am not proficient yet in advanced tools or programming languages like r or python, so i would like something simple.

i am sure such a thing exist, i just suck a bit at finding it. it seems very easy, something that would look like this but that would automatically adjust the size and shape:

datascience,"hi,

first off, i am not here to downplay the effectiveness of resumes.

when you are looking for a good job, it helps to have a resume that helps you stand out from the competition. in fact, here is a [good reddit post](
when used correctly, you can use **both your linkedin profile and your standout resume** to get the tech job that you want.

much like your resume, your goal is to **create a great first impression** so that you can get the right tech job that you want.

**why have an optimized linkedin profile anyway?**

* **linkedin has consistently 1.6 billion in monthly visitor traffic.** (that is a lot of people who are actively searching for business and professional connections. this means that you have a lot of people that you can reach out for the right tech job.)
* **linkedin has 810 registered global members** (in a global job marketplace where remote working is a growing mainstay trend, your job employment options are wider with more managers reporting higher productivity levels among remote workers.)
* **according to** [**linkedin**](
**what i am here to discuss here is how you can:**

1. optimize your linkedin profile to generate active conversations
2. use your optimized linkedin profile to generate more connections with your linkedin profile.



**here are a few things that you need to keep in mind when:**

**optimizing your linkedin profile:**

* **create a strong linkedin facial picture** (use a very identifable facial picture where people can clearly see your picture. smile, by the way. your facial picture should be showing how you look like as a person.)
* **create a clear banner picture** (you are  out on a large opportunity to drive traffic to your linkedin profile. your linkedin banner picture is one of the first thing that your potential employers or recruiters will see/present to your prosepective employers. use your linkedin banner picture to showcase specifically how you can be of a service. you can also use your banner picture to have more people message you by placing a call-to-action (""cta"") so that people immediately know how to reach you.)
* **know who your linkedin profile is for.** (one reason that it takes longer to get the tech job that you want is because your linkedin profile is usually broad and is treated like a record. with enough research, you can effectively target the right individual and tailor your linkedin profile to that ""persona"". this way, you can clearly communicate how you are of service to your potential employers.)
* **keep all information relevant when it comes to appealing to right end viewer** (you don't need to list everything but instead you can list relevant information that your end viewer wants to know. today, within a hybrid/remote work environment, most employers are shifting their employees to focus on more higher-value work. tailor your information to clearly address the proposed higher-value responsibilities that your employer is looking for. you can even create new information that tailors to the concerns that your potential employers has when it comes to hiring you directly.)
* **organize your linkedin profile around generating conversions** (this is key but the main point is that you use your linkedin profile to generate more connections - which in turn generates more conversions. conversions are people resp)
* **create external/native media that showcases your expertise** (people are lazy: you can exploit that from your competition. experiment with polls - so your content spreads to ""new"" connections. use short-form video with an in-video call-to-actions (share this video). when your potential employers see your video on your linkedin profile, you can stand apart from your competition.)



*and* **growing your linkedin connections:**

* **focus on generating conversations that transcend off on linkedin** (while linkedin is a great place for you to meet people, you want to move as many as those relationships to direct e-mail. think of linkedin as the public meeting place but the direct e-mail is the place that you can use to connect more intimately with your professional. this way, your messages are not absorbed into a sea of other messages. plus, you have a direct relationship with your potential employer.)
* **build an internal crm** (there are tools that you can use to track your list of crm. if money is tight, use airtable to create a kanban board around a sales process so you can actively track where each employer is at when it comes to hiring you directly. with a crm, you can actively prioritze which potential employer that you want to put more focus upon versus others. this also hastens the time between jobs or even finding a better fulfilling tech job overall.)
* **actively reach out to your list of connections** (you have linkedin connections. you should use them...not like a sociopath. however, you need to be starting active conversations. it may take a week or two to get a response but you need to build a habit of reaching out to your connections (and new connections) on a daily basis so that you always have fresh opportunities that you can always take advantage.)
* **linkedin sales navigator is your best friend** (you can use linkedin sales navigator to target the most active accounts on linkedin. this hastens the response times that you will receive from potential linkedin profiles. plus, you have a rosterof new leads that you can use to generate new leads.)

**if you are interested in how you can grow the connections for your linkedin profile,** [**message me here**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=copyvideo)**.**",how can an optimized linkedin profile help you get the right tech job (faster)?,0,79,6749,14,"hi,

first off, i am not here to downplay the effectiveness of resumes.

when you are looking for a good job, it helps to have a resume that helps you stand out from the competition. in fact, here is a [good reddit post](
when used correctly, you can use **both your linkedin profile and your standout resume** to get the tech job that you want.

much like your resume, your goal is to **create a great first impression** so that you can get the right tech job that you want.

**why have an optimized linkedin profile anyway?**

* **linkedin has consistently 1.6 billion in monthly visitor traffic.** (that is a lot of people who are actively searching for business and professional connections. this means that you have a lot of people that you can reach out for the right tech job.)
* **linkedin has 810 registered global members** (in a global job marketplace where remote working is a growing mainstay trend, your job employment options are wider with more managers reporting higher productivity levels among remote workers.)
* **according to** [**linkedin**](
**what i am here to discuss here is how you can:**

1. optimize your linkedin profile to generate active conversations
2. use your optimized linkedin profile to generate more connections with your linkedin profile.



**here are a few things that you need to keep in mind when:**

**optimizing your linkedin profile:**

* **create a strong linkedin facial picture** (use a very identifable facial picture where people can clearly see your picture. smile, by the way. your facial picture should be showing how you look like as a person.)
* **create a clear banner picture** (you are  out on a large opportunity to drive traffic to your linkedin profile. your linkedin banner picture is one of the first thing that your potential employers or recruiters will see/present to your prosepective employers. use your linkedin banner picture to showcase specifically how you can be of a service. you can also use your banner picture to have more people message you by placing a call-to-action (""cta"") so that people immediately know how to reach you.)
* **know who your linkedin profile is for.** (one reason that it takes longer to get the tech job that you want is because your linkedin profile is usually broad and is treated like a record. with enough research, you can effectively target the right individual and tailor your linkedin profile to that ""persona"". this way, you can clearly communicate how you are of service to your potential employers.)
* **keep all information relevant when it comes to appealing to right end viewer** (you don't need to list everything but instead you can list relevant information that your end viewer wants to know. today, within a hybrid/remote work environment, most employers are shifting their employees to focus on more higher-value work. tailor your information to clearly address the proposed higher-value responsibilities that your employer is looking for. you can even create new information that tailors to the concerns that your potential employers has when it comes to hiring you directly.)
* **organize your linkedin profile around generating conversions** (this is key but the main point is that you use your linkedin profile to generate more connections - which in turn generates more conversions. conversions are people resp)
* **create external/native media that showcases your expertise** (people are lazy: you can exploit that from your competition. experiment with polls - so your content spreads to ""new"" connections. use short-form video with an in-video call-to-actions (share this video). when your potential employers see your video on your linkedin profile, you can stand apart from your competition.)



*and* **growing your linkedin connections:**

* **focus on generating conversations that transcend off on linkedin** (while linkedin is a great place for you to meet people, you want to move as many as those relationships to direct e-mail. think of linkedin as the public meeting place but the direct e-mail is the place that you can use to connect more intimately with your professional. this way, your messages are not absorbed into a sea of other messages. plus, you have a direct relationship with your potential employer.)
* **build an internal crm** (there are tools that you can use to track your list of crm. if money is tight, use airtable to create a kanban board around a sales process so you can actively track where each employer is at when it comes to hiring you directly. with a crm, you can actively prioritze which potential employer that you want to put more focus upon versus others. this also hastens the time between jobs or even finding a better fulfilling tech job overall.)
* **actively reach out to your list of connections** (you have linkedin connections. you should use them...not like a sociopath. however, you need to be starting active conversations. it may take a week or two to get a response but you need to build a habit of reaching out to your connections (and new connections) on a daily basis so that you always have fresh opportunities that you can always take advantage.)
* **linkedin sales navigator is your best friend** (you can use linkedin sales navigator to target the most active accounts on linkedin. this hastens the response times that you will receive from potential linkedin profiles. plus, you have a rosterof new leads that you can use to generate new leads.)
* **always grow your linkedin connections** (shit happens. always grow your linkedin connections so that way, you can always have opportunities on standby. keep posting media that showcases your expertise. this way, you can grow your linkedin connections and have a rainy jar when your job ""unexpectedly"" goes sour: *a manager asks you to work in the office when you are super-productive in your own home*.)

datascience," i have tabular  where each group of 100 rows represents a deployment of a specific geometry that has certain features measured. for example, i have 10000 deployments stored in a column called ""dep,"" which ranges from 1 to 1000. when fitting this  to an xgboost model, the model may mistakenly assume that the deployment numbers have an ordering relationship (e.g., that deployment 1 is less than deployment 2, which is less than deployment 3, and so on). however, this is not the case because all deployments are independent of each other. on the other hand, if i remove the ""dep"" column, the model will not be able to differentiate between the different deployment groups and their unique geometries.

i got the idea of one hot encoding of the column dep, but it's useless as the training set has 7000 deployments while the test set has 3000. if i do a one hot encoding, the shapes will not match (along with a slew of other issues). better think of another approach.

2. my alternative is learning how to code. i have done sql coding and a beginners r course in the past. i enjoyed them and it is the way my brain works. i won't be able to pivot in my current role/ department and would probably have to start my career again.

i worry that i romanticise a career in   over my current role as the grass is always greener. can you please let me know your opinion and if you think   is the way to the light for me?  if so, how / where should i start?

i am uk based if this matters at all.i am at a crossroa in my career - should i continue in my strategic role at the big five or retrain as a  scientist"

the problem is, when i googled variations of ""publicly available bases"", i just found freely available _sets_, the same type of stuff i'd find if i googled ""free sets"".  i figure there have to be actual bases available to the public, because otherwise how would anyone self-teach sql, but clearly i'm using the wrong search terms to find them. 

part of the problem is perhaps that i haven't had a course on what bases even are really -- i just completed a ds minor, but all the projects and assignments we did involved using r and/or python to read in  from a csv or xlxs file. i have a general idea of what bases are and i figured i'd learn more about them as i started using sql (i learned about  cleaning and manipulation almost entirely from doing projects in r) but right now i'm very much a newbie to bases.

it's a desktop application that will allow you to open the most common  file formats (csv, json, excel, avro, parquet etc.) and explore their contents in a nice table, you'll be able to search, filter, sort, group rows or run custom sql.

from the table view you can also create charts and export them as images, or export a subset of the  as another  format, so you can effectively convert between  formats too.

after this i would like to come up with automated platform enhancing tips based on best practices for that specific business (you are not using this ga feature, enabling this would give you x etc.)

you could also define conversion steps for different products/ areas of the website and see if the tracking is coherent or needs adjusting, simplifying the whole naming convention of your website tracking to keep it easy for analysts.

does anyone have experience building a customer churn model for existing and new customers? what approaches have you tried? which all features can i engineer? i do have phi  as it is a healthcare-related problem.

i have three coworkers  - bob, jack, and jill. 

bob spends most of his day asking people what they are working on where he then asks more questions with the intent of finding something he knows about so he can talk about it and essentially try to tell the other person how to do their job. bob did this to me once and i told them to fuck off - they don't do it to me any more but plenty of people entertain bob. 



now jack. i was recently put on a project with jack and jill and i work with jack on other projects. jack and jill were writing code that is planned to be put into production and quite frankly the code base was shit but i never told them. i was asked to come in and extend the capabilities of their code base meanwhile jack has done basically nothing since i have started on the project and jill essentially only attends the meetings now. 

today i was asking jack about a portion of his code that gives inconsistent output for the same input and i asked him if knew why the api did this. jacks response was basically telling me to add an if statement to his code to rerun a rejected request. more or less he dodged the actual question and averted to telling me to do some basic ass thing which i don't need him to tell me how to do; i'm quite confident that just about anyone with a pulse could come up with the same solution but it doesn't actually address the underlying problem and thus might not even be a solution at all. 

this interaction more or less summarizes the sentiment of my interactions with jack.  anytime i do good work to improve the code base he tries to claim credit for it in meetings and any time i ask him questions about the code he wrote his responses are deflective and generally shift into him trying to tell me how to code. i don't know if he is purposely being an ass or if he's just that aloof but it's really starting to get on my nerves. 

now to jill, jill has two things going for her which are a language barrier and a superiority complex. we will be sitting in our weekly team meeting that she participates in where i give an outline of what i have accomplished, what i am still working on, where my work is going, and how it fits into the overall process map (which didn't exist so i made one). no shit, at the end of every meeting jill basically tells me to do what i already said i was going to do except she does so explicitly outlining most of the things i already talked about where she does this with some new words for a twist. maybe this is where the language barrier is a thing - i'm not sure but it's definitely annoying. 



keep in mind that jill and jack are basically the same level as me, we have the same roles / responsibilities only they have masters degrees and less than 1 years work experience and i have a bachelors degree with a couple of years of work experience. 



since i been on the project - jill has basically done nothing but attend meetings and jack, though he has done a slight amount of coding, has pretty much done the same. it's at the point where i don't even understand why our project lead keeps inviting them to the meetings / they keep showing up but that get's outside the intent of this post. 



to extend this further, i have noticed that in my org it's particularly common for the  scientists to walk around telling people what to do and that most of the work is probably done by 40% of the people where many of them just keep to themself.

my friend and i are building a project management platform for ai/  teams (essentially a jira for ml). we aim to develop a -centric, experimental tool that models the ml pipeline to organize workflows, building off the agile methodology of software development. our tool will allow ml engineers to design, track, and manage custom pipelines,  flows, and models all on the cloud. below of a list of some features we plan to introduce:  

**integrations**: include a host of integrations to mlops tools (kubeflow, mlflow, etc), cloud computing services (aws, google cloud, azure), source code management (github, bitbucket)

my company works with two blogger clients: client a with around 5k total monthly readers and client b with around 100k. each has a newsletter they promote via a cta that appears on every page view, and, on average, a gets about 20 new subscribers per month for the newsletter, while b does 800.

for each client, my task is to find a ""smarter"" way to display this cta to readers than merely showing it on every page view, sort of a question of figuring out the ""when"" for each reader so as to improve conversion rate. i have full clickstream  of every reader's page visit along with dwell time, maximum scroll depth, referrer, type of device, etc. as well as every time a reader submits a newsletter signup form. 

what kinds of models would you recommend looking into? would you consider plain predictive ml or something powered by causal influence (which i seen is in vogue these days)? whatever the approach, it'd be great if it could still work with (what i think is) the very small training set i can get out of a's .

i'm a seasoned cybersecurity analyst (threat hunter) and have been focusing on applied statistics,  , and machine learning (classical and deep learning) for the past few years. i also am a full-stack engineer, which helps when creating tools and analytics. i taught myself statistics and probability, linear algebra, and a little calculus, as it's necessary for fully grasping a lot of ds/ml frameworks and methodologies.

i really struggled with imposter syndrome since i started trying to break into   and machine learning. it seems almost everyone has a masters (or two) or a phd. education-wise, i have enough credits for an associates but didn't get the degree. i was working on a bs at the time, so getting the as on paper didn't seem important. i'm extremely outclassed when it comes to degrees. however, what i do have is a considerable amount of domain knowledge, the ability and dedication to learn new topics, and a decent amount of   and machine learning knowledge.

i performed time series analysis (arima, stl decomp, p/acf plots, forecasts), built predictive models and classifiers (kernalized svm,  decision trees, xgboost/random forest), and have played around with gmms, latent profile/class analysis, ica and pca, and t-sne. i also built a cnn and have built and used an autoencoder for anomaly detection. i mention all of that to demonstrate that i gained a small amount of knowledge and experience and to get feedback on how that might stack up against other  scientists or other candidates trying to break into the field. i don't know how to showcase these particular ksas without an advanced degree backing it up. i was able to pass both the python and machine learning assessments on linkedin. the python one had some linear algebra and   questions, which surprised me. the machine learning assessment was a huge boost in confidence as an affirmation of what i learned and how far i come. it's laughable in the comparison and i would never bring it up in an interview, add it to my resume, or use it as a true credential, but it helped me out spiritually.

i'm not wanting to step away from cybersecurity, rather i'd like to bring ds/ml knowledge to bear on the longstanding problems within the industry, namely modernizing defender and detection capabilities. right now, i largely work alone within a larger analyst community. i occasionally link up with some of the  scientists and machine learning engineers with the organization but i'd like to work closer. trying to find that path really reveals my limited qualifications. most positions have degree requirements that are at the grad school level and i can't compete in that arena. could i make up for the lack of degree with certifications? preferably ones that don't themselves have degree requirements (eg, acap requires a masters). if so, what certs would you recommend?

i'm in the blessed situation that my   training has paid off and i now have some job offers to chose from. i write in hopes of getting some advice from some of you pros in regards which job offers i should accept. mostly because the jobs seems to be in different ""clusters"" under the term  . its essentially a choice between:

1. traditional -analysis in a scrum environment. lots of  cleaning and exploratory analysis. low pay, medium it-skill.

2. -analysis oriented towards business intelligence including automation/etl, sql, powerbi and more socially interactive in conveying results and helping non-analyst coworkers. medium pay but higher potential, low-medium it skill.

3. straight ds including working in an agile/scrum environment, mainly doing analyst + machine learning to find solutions to a multitude of services in the public county. low pay, high it skill.

since i don't have any experience yet i'm not sure which direction i personally prefer. i think i'm best off just getting any experience. but already now i have the choice to impact my ds career by which job i accept. however i think the business job sounds good because i will learn basic etl, automation, more like all-around it skills, but i'm also afraid of it not being technically advanced enough and i'll be stuck as a dashboard and simple descriptive statistics monkey that will always be a business guy. then theres the more ""it solid"" jobs that has a better it infrastructure already, more technical coworkers, agile procedures, but whats the future in this? i will just stand on what others have built perhaps and not advance in regards to social aspects or domain knowledge.

================================================================================

greetings, i just recently received a project from one of my clients in which they would like to develop a recommender system. the company is related to education. 

thus, they would like to have a system that can recommended a list of courses to the user based on their input/personality/characteristics/etc. 

i never worked on this kind of system so i'm a bit lost. what i have gathered is, in recommender systems, they are a few ways to go about this. 

the first approach that i seen is called content-based filtering. the second would be collaborative filtering. 

content-based filtering is simply suggesting items that are similar to the items that the user is fond of. for instance, i like apple juice, so it is possible that i might like orange juice as well. (hopefully my understanding is correct).

for collaborative filtering on the other hand, the suggestions are not based on the content/items, but rather on how similar the users are among each other. for instance, i like apple juice, and a friend of my likes apple and orange juice. so, since we have some similarity with one another, he suggests me to have orange juice. so, i'm guessing this is how collaborative filtering works. 

what i'm having trouble right now is, how am i supposed to go about this for recommending online courses? if i were to go with collaborative filtering, i would need a lot of users in my system. so, let's assume that there's not much traffic in the system as of now. this would result in inaccurate recommendations. 

if i were to go with content-based filtering, i would need the user to enter a few courses that they have enrolled before. i think..   


both of these approaches have a similar problem which is called ""cold-start problem"". in which, i would need some input from them, in order to make some ""viable"" recommendations.

what if i were to make a survey, and based on their input, i would recommend them a list of courses based on what they chose? if i were to choose this approach, i can't see how the  would look like, or even how i'm supposed to train the model for recommending. on top of that, i don't see how i'm going to export the model and apply it to a rest api.

datascience,"i am thinking right now if it is something that could be worthwhile. i know it is a very personal decision and of course, there are lot of factors that can affect the decision. so, i will give some context and some specific questions. 



1) not from the 'first world'. i am from colombia, and that's an important point to be told. why? because of the cost. a master, it is usually very expensive. but here, they are quite expensive in contrast with the average income. it is what it is, so, if i start a master, i will have to take a long-term credit to pay it. 



2) not planning to stay in colombia. i do not know when, how. but i will go out of latam. it is simple, i understand that i can get a good job here buuut still, not good enough compared with all the effort i’m putting in this. i will never be equally well paid here, then; let’s say, a 'a first world country'. if you are from latam, you'll understand what i’m saying.



3) here, i am almost done with my statistics career. true be told, i have learned a lot of statistics concepts but, in general; ml, deep learning and so on, are terms that i have 'heard' about them but are not something that i had studied. neither my academic 'career' (degree. it is not the same here than in us, for example) or personal studies. so, ii have two options that are quite possible. 

i can enroll myself in a master and, somehow; there i will learn about... ml(?) become a better candidate to a foreign company(?) i mean, i guess there is a potential that i’m not seeing in taking a master... but i suppose that, if i’m planning to live outside my country, i guess a master is an advantage. not clear how. i’m just guessing...



or... i can prepare myself with online courses such as, coursera, platzi and other online platforms where i can actually learn in a low-cost mode. i am thinking to take this path but, i lack a person who can actually guide me and give me a 'wise' advice. is it correct to do this? 



now, about my profile... as i said, i am enrolled in a university in colombia, i am finishing my career (less than a year to graduate) and hopefully, i will get my studies done. what studies? well, i have studies lot of mats and algebra concepts, statistics concepts; that why i could understand almost ay topic with linear algebra and, if i need it to; i could understand how to manipulate , fit a model, predict, etc. etc. so, could be better my profile? yes. that´s why i am asking.  how can i make it better?





finally, regarding my 'programming skills', i am r-studio dependent. i know in some point i will have to learn python, sql, azure, etc. let’s say, i have 'the logic' to understand a language, but i haven’t work with any other language. plus, i feel very comfortable in r and not very fond with python. 



so, what should i do? i would like to read some advice of some persons who actually have experience in the industry. what should i expect regarding my profile? will it be better with a master or not? should i be working instead, in learning on my own? any useful advice? what to study?  where to start?

i am using a lenovo p53s workstation with a nvidia quadro p520 which has only 2gb memory. i often get that pytorch error that i don’t have enough memory. i am thinking about buying a nvidia jetson with 4gb memory because i don’t want to buy an external graphic card. is this a good solution for smaller cv projects?

datascience,"hey everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this and offer advice.

i am a new  scientist without a strong software engineering background. i am the only  scientist at my company, and the only person who writes code other than a few people in our it department, but they focus mainly on our erp system and our bases. 

most of the project that i am working on go something like this. ""we want to create a software tool that does x (forecasting, modeling, etc.   stuff)"". then on my own, i figure out how to ""do"" it, and start coding. as i work, my code base gets more convoluted.

to address this, i taken a software engineering 101 course on udemy, and it was helpful for the ""planning"" phase. i.e. spend more time up front gathering requirements and turning them into specifications. however i haven't found any good resources for how to ""structure"" my code base at a high level. 

can anyone provide any references where i can learn some of these best practices? 

to be clear, i'm not asking you guys/gals to answer these for me (although i'd appreciate the advice). i'm wondering if you know of any good learning tools that would teach these things. i'm happy to take courses if available but haven't been able to find one.

for example: 

1. should i have a separate .py file where i define all of my functions, or should i define them in the script in which they will be used?
2. although it may change greatly project to project, is there a best practice set of guidelines i should follow to set up my folder structure? i.e. an input  folder, an output  folder, etc?
3. how can i schedule my program to run every month so i don't have to do it manually?
4. so far, i have set up individual anaconda virtual environments for each project, and doing all dev in spyder. does this mean that only i can run the script from my computer? is there a better way to create a project with all required packages so that anyone can run it without them needing anaconda installed?
5. should i have a 'requirements.txt' file? what should be in it?
6. should i have a 'utils'txt' file? what should be in it?
7. should i have different .py scripts that do different things, and call them in series? or should i have one '[main.py](
